// .NAME vtkFixedPointRayCastImage - helper class for a ray cast image
// .SECTION Description
// This is a helper class for storing the ray cast image including the
// underlying data and the size of the image. This class is not intended
// to be used directly - just as an internal class in the 
// vtkFixedPointVolumeRayCastMapper so that multiple mappers can share
// the same image. Perhaps this class could be generalized
// in the future to be used for other ray cast methods other than the
// fixed point method.

// .SECTION see also
// vtkFixedPointVolumeRayCastMapper
