// .NAME vtkDividingCubes - create points lying on isosurface
// .SECTION Description
// vtkDividingCubes is a filter that generates points lying on a surface
// of constant scalar value (i.e., an isosurface). Dense point clouds (i.e.,
// at screen resolution) will appear as a surface. Less dense clouds can be 
// used as a source to generate streamlines or to generate "transparent"
// surfaces. This filter is based on the generate program written by
// H. Cline, S. Ludke and W. Lorensen.
