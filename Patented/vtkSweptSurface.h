// .NAME vtkSweptSurface - given a path and input geometry generate an (implicit) representation of a swept surface
// .SECTION Description
// vtkSweptSurface is a filter that is used to create a surface defined by 
// moving a part along a path. In this implementation, the path is defined as
// a list of transformation matrices (vtkTransform), and the part geometry is
// implicitly defined using a volume (i.e., distance scalars in structured 
// point dataset). The input to the filter is the geometry (i.e., a 
// structured point dataset) and the output is a structured point dataset 
// (i.e., an implicit representation of the swept surface). If you wish to
// generate a polygonal representation of swept surface you will have to 
// use a contouring filter (e.g., vtkContourFilter). (You may also wish to
// use vtkDecimate to reduce mesh size.)
//
// The swept surface algorithm can be summarized as follows. A geometry 
// (i.e. the input) is swept along a path (list of transforms). At each point
// on the path the input is re-sampled into a volume using a union operation.
// (Union means that the minimum scalar value is retained - minimum distance
// value for example.) At the end, an implicit representation of the swept
// surface is defined.

  // the lower the error but the greater the processing time.

  // Specify a path (i.e., list of transforms) that the input moves along. At
  // least two transforms must be used to define a path.
  vtkSetObjectMacro(Transforms, vtkTransformCollection);

  // value is used, since the scalar values are assumed to be a distance 
  // function.

  // Description:
  // Value specifies/controls interpolation between the nodes (i.e., 
  // transforms) defining the path. A positive value indicates the number
  // of steps to take between transforms (i.e., interpolation is performed).
  // A negative value indicates that no interpolation to be performed, that is,
  // only the points defined at each transform are used (interpolation not
  // performed). A zero value indicates that automatic interpolation is to be
  // performed, that is, interpolation is computed so that potential errors 
  // fall below the error bounds defined in the text. By default, automatic
  // computation is performed (Interpolation = 0).

  // if you are limited in computation time or just know that the number of 
  // computed steps should not exceed a certain value.
  vtkSetMacro(MaximumNumberOfInterpolationSteps,int);
  vtkGetMacro(MaximumNumberOfInterpolationSteps,int);

  // Description:
  // The outer boundary of the sampling volume can be capped (i.e., assigned 
  // fill value). This will "close" the implicit model if the geometry 
  // approaches close to or passes through the boundary of the volume (i.e.,
  // defined by ModelBounds instance variable). Capping turns on/off this 
  // capability. By default capping is on.

  // Description:
  // Define the volume (in world coordinates) in which the sampling is to 
  // occur. Make sure that the volume is large enough to accommodate the 
  // motion of the geometry along the path. If the model bounds are set to
  // all zero values, the model bounds will be computed automatically from
  // the input geometry and path.

  // Description:
  // Control how the model bounds are computed. If the ivar AdjustBounds
  // is set, then the bounds specified (or computed automatically) is modified
  // by the fraction given by AdjustDistance. This means that the model
  // bounds is expanded in each of the x-y-z directions.

  // of the box specified by the model bounds.
