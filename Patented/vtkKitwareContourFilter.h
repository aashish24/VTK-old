// .NAME vtkKitwareContourFilter - generate isosurfaces/isolines from scalar values
// .SECTION Description
// vtkKitwareContourFilter is a filter that takes as input any dataset and 
// generates on output isosurfaces and/or isolines. The exact form 
// of the output depends upon the dimensionality of the input data. 
// Data consisting of 3D cells will generate isosurfaces, data 
// consisting of 2D cells will generate isolines, and data with 1D 
// or 0D cells will generate isopoints. Combinations of output type 
// are possible if the input dimension is mixed.
//
// This filter will identify special dataset types (e.g., structured
// points) and use the appropriate specialized filter to process the
// data. For examples, if the input dataset type is a volume, this
// filter will create an internal vtkSyncronizedTemplates3D instance 
// and use it. This gives much better performance on StructuredPoints 
// and StructuredGrids.
// 
// To use this filter you must specify one or more contour values.
// You can either use the method SetValue() to specify each contour
// value, or use GenerateValues() to generate a series of evenly
// spaced contours. It is also possible to accelerate the operation of
// this filter (at the cost of extra memory) by using a
// vtkScalarTree. A scalar tree is used to quickly locate cells that
// contain a contour surface. This is especially effective if multiple
// contours are being extracted. If you want to use a scalar tree,
// invoke the method UseScalarTreeOn().

// .SECTION Caveats
// For StructuredPoints And StructuredGrids, normals are computed
// by default, but it is an expensive computation.  Processing for 
// other data set types has not been extended to include normal 
// computation.  In the mean time, use vtkPolyDataNormals to compute 
// the surface normals.
