// .NAME vtkSliceCubes - generate isosurface(s) from volume four slices at a time
// .SECTION Description
// vtkSliceCubes is a special version of the marching cubes filter. Instead
// of ingesting an entire volume at once it processes only four slices at
// a time. This way, it can generate isosurfaces from huge volumes. Also, the 
// output of this object is written to a marching cubes triangle file. That
// way, output triangles do not need to be held in memory.
// 
// To use vtkSliceCubes you must specify an instance of vtkVolumeReader to
// read the data. Set this object up with the proper file prefix, image range,
// data origin, data dimensions, header size, data mask, and swap bytes flag. 
// The vtkSliceCubes object will then take over and read slices as necessary. 
// You also will need to specify the name of an output marching cubes triangle 
// file.
//
// .SECTION Caveats
// This process object is both a source and mapper (i.e., it reads and writes 
// data to a file). This is different than the other marching cubes objects 
// (and most process objects in the system). It's specialized to handle very 
// large data.
//
// This object only extracts a single isosurface. This compares with the other
// contouring objects in vtk that generate multiple surfaces.
//
// To read the output file use vtkMCubesReader.
