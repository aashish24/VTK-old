 *  \class vtkQtChartMouseBox
 *  \brief
 *    The vtkQtChartMouseBox class is used to draw a mouse box that
 *    can be used for zooming or selection.
 * 
 *  To use the vtkQtChartMouseBox, code needs to be added to several
 *  key methods. The drag box interaction starts in the mouse press
 *  event. The box grows or shrinks in the mouse move event. In the
 *  mouse release event, the box is finalized and used for its
 *  intent (zoom, select, etc.).
 * 
 *  In the mouse press event, the mouse location needs to be saved.
 *  The position should be in the mouse box's parent coordinates.
 *  \code
 *  void SomeClass::mousePressEvent(QMouseEvent *e)
 *  {
 *    this->mouseBox->setPos(e->pos());
 *    this->mouseBox->setVisible(true);
 *  }
 *  \endcode
 * 
 *  In the mouse move event, the drag box needs to be updated. The
 *  point set in the mouse press event should remain unchanged until
 *  the mouse release event. If your class watches all mouse move
 *  events, make sure the box is only updated for drag events.
 *  \code
 *  void SomeClass::mouseMoveEvent(QMouseEvent *e)
 *  {
 *    this->mouseBox->adjustRectangle(this->mouseBox->mapFromScene(e->pos()));
 *  }
 *  \endcode
 * 
 *  In the mouse release event, the drag box needs to be updated
 *  with the release location before using it. After using the box,
 *  it should be hidden.
 *  \code
 *  void SomeClass::mouseReleaseEvent(QMouseEvent *e)
 *  {
 *    this->mouseBox->adjustRectangle(this->mouseBox->mapFromScene(e->pos()));
 *    ...
 *    this->mouseBox->setVisible(false);
 *  }
 *  \endcode
