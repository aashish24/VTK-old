// .NAME vtkWarpScalar - deform geometry with scalar data
// .SECTION Description
// vtkWarpScalar is a filter that modifies point coordinates by moving
// points along point normals by the scalar amount times the scale factor.
// Useful for creating carpet or x-y-z plots.
//
// If normals are not present in data, the Normal instance variable will
// be used as the direction along which to warp the geometry. If normals are
// present but you would like to use the Normal instance variable, set the 
// UseNormal boolean to true.
//
// If XYPlane boolean is set true, then the z-value is considered to be 
// a scalar value (still scaled by scale factor), and the displacement is
// along the z-axis. If scalars are also present, these are copied through
// and can be used to color the surface.
//
// Note that the filter passes both its point data and cell data to
// its output, except for normals, since these are distorted by the
// warping.
