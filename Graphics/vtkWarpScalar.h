// .NAME vtkWarpScalar - deform geometry with scalar data
// .SECTION Description
// vtkWarpScalar is a filter that modifies point coordinates by moving
// points along point normals by the scalar amount times the scale factor.
// Useful for creating carpet or x-y-z plots.
//    If normals are not present in data, the Normal instance variable will
// be used as the direction along which to warp the geometry. If normals are
// present but you would like to use the Normals instance variable, set the 
// UseNormals boolean to true.
//    If XYPlane boolean is set true, then the z-value is considered to be 
// a scalar value (still scaled by scale factor) and the displacement is
// along the z-axis. If scalars are also present, these are copied through
// and can be used to color the surface.

  // Description:
