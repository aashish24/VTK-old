// .NAME vtkProbeFilter - sample data values at specified point locations
// .SECTION Description
// vtkProbeFilter is a filter that computes point attributes (e.g., scalars,
// vectors, etc.) at specified point positions. The filter has two inputs:
// the Input and Source. The Input geometric structure is passed through the
// filter. The point attributes are computed at the Input point positions
// by interpolating into the source data. For example, we can compute data
// values on a plane (plane specified as Input) from a volume (Source).

  // Description:
  // This flag is used only when a piece is requested to update.  By default
  // the flag is off.  Because no spatial correspondence between input pieces
  // and source pieces is known, all of the source has to be requested no
  // matter what piece of the output is requested.  When there is a spatial 
  // correspondence, the user/application can set this flag.  This hint allows
  // the breakup of the probe operation to be much more efficient.  When piece
  // m of n is requested for update by the user, then only n of m needs to
  // be requested of the source.
