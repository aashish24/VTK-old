// .NAME vtkProbeFilter - compute data values at specified point locations
// .SECTION Description
// vtkProbeFilter is a filter that computes point attributes (e.g., scalars,
// vectors, etc.) at point positions in the input. The point positions
// are obtained from the points in the source object.
