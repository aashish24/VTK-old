// .NAME vtkButterflySubdivisionFilter - generate a subdivision surface using the Butterfly Scheme
// .SECTION Description
// vtkButterflySubdivisionFilter is an interpolating subdivision scheme
// that creates four new triangles for each triangle in the mesh. The
// user can specifiy the NumberOfSubdivisions. This filter implements the
// 8-point butterfly scheme described in: Zorin, D., Schroder, P., and
// Sweldens, W., "Interpolating Subdivisions for Meshes with Arbitrary
// Topology," Computer Graphics Proceedings, Annual Conference Series,
// 1996, ACM SIGGRAPH, pp.189-192. This scheme improves previous
// butterfly subdivisions with special treatment of vertices with valence
// other than 6.
// <P>
// Currently, the filter only operates on triangles. Users should use the
// vtkTriangleFilter to triangulate meshes that contain polygons or
// triangle stiprs.
// <P>
// The filter interpolates point data using the same scheme. New
// triangles created at a subdivision step will have the cell data of
// their parent cell.
