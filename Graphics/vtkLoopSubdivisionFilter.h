// .NAME vtkLoopSubdivisionFilter - generate a subdivision surface using the Loop Scheme
// .SECTION Description
// vtkLoopSubdivisionFilter is an approximating subdivision scheme that
// creates four new triangles for each triangle in the mesh. The user can
// specify the NumberOfSubdivisions. Loop's subdivision scheme is
// described in: Loop, C., "Smooth Subdivision surfaces based on
// triangles,", Masters Thesis, University of Utah, August 1987.
// For a nice summary of the technique see, Hoppe, H., et. al,
// "Piecewise Smooth Surface Reconstruction,:, Proceedings of Siggraph 94
// (Orlando, Florida, July 24-29, 1994). In COmputer Graphics
// Proceedings, Annual COnference Series, 1994, ACM SIGGRAPH,
// pp. 295-302.
// <P>
// The filter only operates on triangles. Users should use the
// vtkTriangleFilter to triangulate meshes that contain polygons or
// triangle strips.
// <P>
// The filter approximates point data using the same scheme. New
// triangles create at a subdivision step will have the cell data of
// their parent cell.
