// .NAME vtkStructuredGridOutlineFilter - create wireframe outline for structured grid
// .SECTION Description
// vtkStructuredGridOutlineFilter is a filter that generates a wireframe 
// outline of a structured grid (vtkStructuredGrid). Structured data is 
// topologically a cube, so the outline will have 12 "edges".
