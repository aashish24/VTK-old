// .NAME vtkTransformPolyDataFilter - transform points and associated normals and vectors for polygonal dataset
// .SECTION Description
// vtkTransformPolyDataFilter is a filter to transform point
// coordinates and associated point and cell normals and
// vectors. Other point and cell data is passed through the filter
// unchanged. This filter is specialized for polygonal data. See
// vtkTransformFilter for more general data.
//
// An alternative method of transformation is to use vtkActor's methods
// to scale, rotate, and translate objects. The difference between the
// two methods is that vtkActor's transformation simply effects where
// objects are rendered (via the graphics pipeline), whereas
// vtkTransformPolyDataFilter actually modifies point coordinates in the 
// visualization pipeline. This is necessary for some objects 
// (e.g., vtkProbeFilter) that require point coordinates as input.
