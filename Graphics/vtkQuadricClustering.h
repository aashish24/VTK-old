// .NAME vtkQuadricClustering - reduce the number of triangles in a mesh
// .SECTION Description

// vtkQuadricClustering is a filter to reduce the number of triangles in a
// triangle mesh, forming a good approximation to the original geometry.  The
// input to vtkQuadricClustering is a vtkPolyData object, and only triangles
// are treated. If you desire to decimate polygonal meshes, first triangulate
// the polygons with vtkTriangleFilter object. 
//
// The algorithm used is the one described by Peter Lindstrom in his Siggraph
// 2000 paper, "Out-of-Core Simplification of Large Polygonal Models."  The
// general approach of the algorithm is to cluster vertices in a uniform
// binning of space, accumulating the quadric of each triangle (pushed out to
// the triangles vertices) within each bin, and then determining an optimal
// position for a single vertex in a bin by using the accumulated quadric. In
// more detail, the algorithm first gets the bounds of the input poly data.
// It then breaks this bounding volume into a user-specified number of
// spatial bins.  It then reads each triangle from the input and hashes its
// vertices into these bins.  (If this is the first time a bin has been
// visited, initialize its quadric to the 0 matrix.)  If 2 or more vertices
// of the triangle fall in the same bin, the triangle is dicarded.  If the
// triangle is not discarded, the algorithm then computes the error quadric
// for this triangle and adds it to the existing quadric for each bin
// corresponding to a vertex of this triangle.  It adds the triangle to the
// list of output triangles as a list of vertex identifiers.  (There is one
// vertex id per bin.)  After all the triangles have been read, the
// representative vertex for each bin is computed using the quadric for that
// bin.  This determines the spatial location of the vertices of each of the
// triangles in the output.
//
// To use this filter, specify the divisions defining the spatial subdivision
// in the x, y, and z directions. You must also specify an input vtkPolyData.

// .SECTION Caveats
// This filter can drastically affect topology, i.e., topology is not 
// preserved.
