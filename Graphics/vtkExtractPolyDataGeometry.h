// .NAME vtkExtractPolyDataGeometry - extract poly data that lies either entirely inside or outside of a specified implicit function

// .SECTION Description
// vtkExtractPolyDataGeometry extracts from its input vtkPolyData all cells
// that are either completely inside or outside of a specified implicit
// function. Any type of dataset can be input to this filter. On output the
// filter generates an unstructured grid.
//
// To use this filter you must specify an implicit function. You can also
// choose to extract the inside or outside data. (The inside of an implicit
// function is the negative values region.)

// .SECTION See Also
// vtkExtractGeometry vtkClipPolyData
