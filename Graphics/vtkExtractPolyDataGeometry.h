// .NAME vtkExtractPolyDataGeometry - extract vtkPolyData cells that lies either entirely inside or outside of a specified implicit function

// .SECTION Description
// vtkExtractPolyDataGeometry extracts from its input vtkPolyData all cells
// that are either completely inside or outside of a specified implicit
// function. This filter is specialized to vtkPolyData. On output the 
// filter generates vtkPolyData.
//
// To use this filter you must specify an implicit function. You must also
// specify whethter to extract cells lying inside or outside of the implicit 
// function. (The inside of an implicit function is the negative values 
// region.) An option exists to extract cells that are neither inside or
// outside (i.e., boundary).
//
// A more general version of this filter is available for arbitrary
// vtkDataSet input (see vtkExtractGeometry).

// .SECTION See Also
// vtkExtractGeometry vtkClipPolyData
