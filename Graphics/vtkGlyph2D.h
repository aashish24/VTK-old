// .NAME vtkGlyph2D - copy oriented and scaled glyph geometry to every input point (2D specialization)
// .SECTION Description
// This subclass of vtkGlyph3D is a specialization to 2D. Transformations
// (i.e., translation, scaling, and rotation) are constrained to the plane.
// For example, rotations due to a vector are computed from the x-y
// coordinates of the vector only, and are assumed to occur around the
// z-axis. (See vtkGlyph3D for documentation on the interface to this
// class.)
// 
// .SECTION See Also
// vtkTensorGlyph vtkGlyph3D vtkProgrammableGlyphFilter

  // Description
  // Construct object with scaling on, scaling mode is by scalar value, 
  // scale factor = 1.0, the range is (0,1), orient geometry is on, and
  // orientation is by vector. Clamping and indexing are turned off. No
  // initial sources are defined.
