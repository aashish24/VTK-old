// .NAME vtkPolyDataNormals - compute normals for polygonal mesh
// .SECTION Description
// vtkPolyDataNormals is a filter that computes point normals for a polygonal 
// mesh. The filter can reorder polygons to insure consistent orientation
// across polygon neighbors. Sharp edges can be split and points duplicated
// with separate normals to give crisp (rendered) surface definition. It is
// also possible to globally flip the normal orientation.
//
// The algorithm works by determining normals for each polygon and then
// averaging them at shared points. When sharp edges are present, the edges
// are split and new points generated to prevent blurry edges (due to 
// Gouraud shading).

// .SECTION Caveats
// Normals are computed only for polygons and triangle strips. Normals are
// not computed for lines or vertices.
//
// Triangle strips are broken up into triangle polygons. You may want to 
// restrip the triangles.
