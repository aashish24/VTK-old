// .NAME vtkMergeFilter - extract separate components of data from different datasets
// .SECTION Description
// vtkMergeFilter is a filter that extracts separate components of data from
// different datasets and merges them into a single dataset. The output from
// this filter is of the same type as the input (i.e., vtkDataSet.) It treats 
// both cell and point data set attributes.
