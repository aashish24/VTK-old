// .NAME vtkTriangularTCoords - 2D texture coordinates based for triangles.
// .SECTION Description
// vtkTriangularTCoords is a filter that generates texture coordinates
// for triangles. Texture coordinates for each triangle are:
// (0,0), (1,0) and (.5,sqrt(3)/2). This filter assumes that the triangle
// texture map is symmetric about the center of the triangle. Thus the order
// Of the texture coordinates is not important. The procedural texture
// in vtkTriangularTexture is designed with this symmetry. For more information
// see the paper "Opacity-modulating Triangular Textures for Irregular 
// Surfaces,"  by Penny Rheingans, IEEE Visualization '96, pp. 219-225.
