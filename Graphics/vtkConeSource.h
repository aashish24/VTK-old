// .NAME vtkConeSource - generate polygonal cone 
// .SECTION Description
// vtkConeSource creates a cone centered at origin and pointing down the 
// x-axis. Depending upon the resolution of this object, different 
// representations are created. If resolution=0 a line is created; if 
// resolution=1, a single triangle is created; if resolution=2, two 
// crossed triangles are created. For resolution > 2, a 3D cone (with 
// resolution number of sides) is created. It also is possible to control 
// whether the bottom of the cone is capped with a (resolution-sided) 
// polygon, and to specify the height and radius of the cone.
