// .NAME vtkThresholdPoints - extracts points whose scalar value satisfies threshold criterion
// .SECTION Description
// vtkThresholdPoints is a filter that extracts points from a dataset that 
// satisfy a threshold criterion. The criterion can take three forms:
// 1) greater than a particular value; 2) less than a particular value; or
// 3) between a particular value. The output of the filter is polygonal data.
