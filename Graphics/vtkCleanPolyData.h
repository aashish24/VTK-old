// .NAME vtkCleanPolyData - merge duplicate points and remove degenerate primitives
// .SECTION Description
// vtkCleanPolyData is a filter that takes polygonal data as input and 
// generates polygonal as output. vtkCleanPolyData merges duplicate 
// points (within specified tolerance), and transforms degenerate 
// topology into appropriate form (for example, triangle is converted
// into line if two points of triangle are merged).
//
// If tolerance is specified precisely=0.0, then this object will use
// the vtkMergePoints object to merge points (very fast). Otherwise the 
// slower vtkPointLocator is used.

// .SECTION Caveats
// Merging points can alter topology, including introducing non-manifold 
// forms. Tolerance should be chosen carefully to avoid these problems.
