// .NAME vtkVectorDot - generate scalars from dot product of vectors and normals (e.g., show displacement plot)
// .SECTION Description
// vtkVectorDot is a filter to generate scalar values from a dataset.
// The scalar value at a point is created by computing the dot product 
// between the normal and vector at that point. Combined with the appropriate
// color map, this can show nodal lines/mode shapes of vibration, or a 
// displacement plot.
