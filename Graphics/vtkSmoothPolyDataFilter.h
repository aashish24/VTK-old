// .NAME vtkSmoothPolyDataFilter - adjust point positions using Laplacian smoothing
// .SECTION Description
// vtkSmoothPolyDataFilter is a filter that adjusts point coordinates using 
// Laplacian smoothing. The effect is to "relax" the mesh, making the cells 
// better shaped and the vertices more evenly distributed. Note that this
// filter operates on the lines, polygons, and triangle strips composing an
// instance of vtkPolyData. Vertex or poly-vertex cells are never modified.
// 
// The algorithm proceeds as follows. For each vertex v, a topological and
// geometric analysis is performed to determine which vertices are connected
// to v, and which cells are connected to v. Then, a connectivity array is
// constructed for each vertex. (The connectivity array is a list of lists
// of vertices that directly attach to each vertex.) Next, an iteration
// phase begins over all vertices. For each vertex v, the coordinates of v
// are modified according to an average of the connected vertices.  (A
// relazation factor is available to control the amount of displacement of
// v).  The process repeats for each vertex. This pass over the list of
// vertices is a single iteration. Many iterations (generally around 20 or
// so) are repeated until the desired result is obtained.
// 
// There are some special instance variables used to control the execution
// of this filter. (These ivars basically control what vertices can be
// smoothed, and the creation of the connectivity array.) The
// BoundarySmoothing ivar enables/disables the smoothing operation on
// vertices that are on the "boundary" of the mesh. A boundary vertex is one
// that is surrounded by a semi-cycle of polygons (or used by a single
// line).
// 
// Another important ivar is FeatureEdgeSmoothing. If this ivar is
// enabled, then interior vertices are classified as either "simple",
// "interior edge", or "fixed", and smoothed differently. (Interior
// vertices are manifold vertices surrounded by a cycle of polygons; or used
// by two line cells.) The classification is based on the number of feature 
// edges attached to v. A feature edge occurs when the angle between the two
// surface normals of a polygon sharing an edge is greater than the
// FeatureAngle ivar. Then, vertices used by no feature edges are classified
// "simple", vertices used by exactly two feature edges are classified
// "interior edge", and all others are "fixed" vertices.
//
// Once the classification is known, the vertices are smoothed
// differently. Corner (i.e., fixed) vertices are not smoothed at all. 
// Simple vertices are smoothed as before (i.e., average of connected 
// vertex coordinates). Interior edge vertices are smoothed only along 
// their two connected edges, and only if the angle between the edges 
// is less than the EdgeAngle ivar.
//
// The total smoothing can be controlled by using two ivars. The 
// NumberOfIterations is a cap on the maximum numper of smoothing passes.
// The Convergence ivar is a limit on the maximum point motion. If the 
// maximum motion during an iteration is less than Convergence, then the 
// smoothing process terminates. (Convergence is expressed as a fraction of 
// the diagonal of the bounding box.)
//
// There are two instance variables that control the generation of error
// data. If the ivar GenerateErrorScalars is on, then a scalar value indicating
// the distance of each vertex from its original position is computed. If the
// ivar GenerateErrorVectors is on, then a vector representing change in 
// position is computed.
//
// .SECTION Caveats
// The Laplacian operation reduces high frequency information in the
// geometry of the mesh. With excessive smoothing important details may be
// lost. Enabling FeatureEdgeSmoothing helps reduce this effect, but cannot
// entirely eliminate it.
