// .NAME vtkTextureMapToSphere - generate texture coordinates by mapping points to sphere
// .SECTION Description
// vtkTextureMapToSphere is a filter that generates 2D texture coordinates
// by mapping input dataset points onto a sphere. The sphere can either be
// user specified or generated automatically. (The sphere is generated 
// automatically by computing the center (i.e., averaged coordinates) of the sphere.)
// Note that the generated texture coordinates range beween (0,1). The s-coordinate
// lies in the angular direction around the z-axis, measured counter-clockwise from the
// x-axis. The t-coordinate lies in the angular direction measured down from the north
// pole towards the south pole.
//
// A special ivar controls how the s-coordinate is generated. If PreventSeam
// is set to true, the s-texture varies from 0->1 and then 1->0 (corresponding
// to angles of 0->180 and 180->360).

// .Section Caveats
// The resulting texture coordinates will lie between (0,1), and the texture coordinates
// are determined with respect to the modeller's x-y-z coordinate system. Use the class 
// vtkTransformTextureCoords to linearly scale and shift the origin of the texture
// coordinates (if necessary).
