// .NAME vtkTextureMapToSphere - generate texture coordinates by mapping points to sphere
// .SECTION Description
// vtkTextureMapToSphere is a filter that generates 2D texture coordinates by
// mapping input dataset points onto a sphere. The sphere can either be user
// specified or generated automatically. (The sphere is generated
// automatically by computing the center (i.e., averaged coordinates) of the
// sphere.)  Note that the generated texture coordinates range beween
// (0,1). The s-coordinate lies in the angular direction around the z-axis,
// measured counter-clockwise from the x-axis. The t-coordinate lies in the
// angular direction measured down from the north pole towards the south
// pole.
//
// A special ivar controls how the s-coordinate is generated. If PreventSeam
// is set to true, the s-texture varies from 0->1 and then 1->0 (corresponding
// to angles of 0->180 and 180->360).

// .SECTION Caveats
// The resulting texture coordinates will lie between (0,1), and the texture
// coordinates are determined with respect to the modeller's x-y-z coordinate
// system. Use the class vtkTransformTextureCoords to linearly scale and
// shift the origin of the texture coordinates (if necessary).
