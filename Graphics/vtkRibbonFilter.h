// .NAME vtkRibbonFilter - create oriented ribbons from lines defined in polygonal dataset
// .SECTION Description
// vtkRibbonFilter is a filter to create oriented ribbons from lines defined
// in polygonal dataset. The orientation of the ribbon is along the line 
// segments and perpendicular to "projected" line normals. Projected line 
// normals are the original line normals projected to be perpendicular to 
// the local line segment. An offset angle can be specified to rotate the 
// ribbon with respect to the normal.
//
// The input line must not have duplicate points, or normals at points that
// are parallel to the incoming/outgoing line segments. (Duplicate points
// can be removed with vtkCleanPolyData).
