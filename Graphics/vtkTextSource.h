// .NAME vtkTextSource - create polygonal text
// .SECTION Description
// vtkTextSource converts a text string into polygons.  This way you can 
// insert text into your renderings. It uses the 9x15 font from X Windows.
// You can specify if you want the background to be drawn or not. The
// characters are formed by scan converting the raster font into
// quadrilaterals. Colors are assigned to the letters using scalar data.
// To set the color of the characters with the source's actor property, set
// BackingOff on the text source and ScalarVisibilityOff on the associated
// vtkPolyDataMapper. Then, the color can be set using the associated actor's
// property.
//
// vtkVectorText generates higher quality polygonal representations of
// characters.

// .SECTION See Also
// vtkVectorText
