// .NAME vtkOBBTree - generate oriented bounding box (OBB) tree
// .SECTION Description
// vtkOBBTree is an object to generate oriented bounding box (OBB) trees.
// An oriented bounding box is a bounding box that does not necessarily line 
// up along coordinate axes. The OBB tree is a hierarchical tree structure 
// of such boxes, where deeper levels of OBB confine smaller regions of space.
//
// To build the OBB, a recursive, top-down process is used. First, the root OBB
// is constructed by finding the mean and covariance matrix of the cells (and
// their points) that define the dataset. The eigenvectors of the covariance
// matrix are extracted, giving a set of three orthogonal vectors that define 
// the tightest-fitting OBB. To create the two children OBB's, a split plane 
// is found that (approximately) divides the number cells in half. These are 
// then assigned to the children OBB's. This process then continues until
// the MaxLevel ivar limits the recursion, or no split plane can be found.
//
// A good reference for OBB-trees is Gottschalk & Manocha in Proceedings of 
// Siggraph `96.

// .SECTION Caveats
// Since this algorithms works from a list of cells, the OBB tree will only 
// bound the "geometry" attached to the cells if the convex hull of the 
// cells bounds the geometry.
//
// Long, skinny cells (i.e., cells with poor aspect ratio) may cause 
// unsatisfactory results. This is due to the fact that this is a top-down
// implementation of the OBB tree, requiring that one or more complete cells
// are contained in each OBB. This requirement makes it hard to find good 
// split planes during the recurion process. A bottom-up implementation would
// go a long way to correcting this problem.
