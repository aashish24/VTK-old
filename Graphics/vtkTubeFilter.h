// .NAME vtkTubeFilter - filter that generates tubes around lines
// .SECTION Description
// vtkTubeFilter is a filter that generates a tube around each input line. 
// The tubes are made up of triangle strips and rotate around the tube with
// the rotation of the line normals. (If no normals are present, they are
// computed automatically). The radius of the tube can be set to vary with 
// scalar value. If the scalar value is speed (i.e., magnitude of velocity),
// the variation of the tube radius is such that it preserves mass flux in
// incompressible flow. The number of sides for the tube can also be 
// specified.
// .SECTION Caveats
// The number of tube sides must be greater than 3. If you wish to use fewer
// sides (i.e., a ribbon), use vtkRibbonFilter.
//    The input line must not have duplicate points, or normals at points that
// are parallel to the incoming/outgoing line segments. (Duplicate points
// can be removed with vtkCleanPolyData).
