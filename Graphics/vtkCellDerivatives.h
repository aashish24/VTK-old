// .NAME vtkCellDerivatives - compute derivatives of scalars and vectors
// .SECTION Description
// vtkCellDerivatives is a filter that computes derivatives of scalars
// and vectors at the center of cells. You can choose to generate
// different output including the scalar gradient (a vector), computed
// tensor vorticity (a vector), gradient of input vectors (a tensor),
// and strain matrix of the input vectors (a tensor); or you may
// choose to pass data through to the output.
//
// Note that it is assumed that on input scalars and vector point data
// is available, which are then used to generate cell vectors and tensors.
// (The interpolation functions of the cells are used to compute the
// derivatives which is why point data is required.)

// .SECTION Caveats
// The computed derivatives are cell attribute data; you can convert them to
// point attribute data by using the vtkCellDataToPointData filter.
// Note that, due to the interpolation function used (obtained using 
// 1/r**2 normalized sum), the derivatives calculated for polygons
// with more than 4 vertices are inaccurate in most cases.
//
// The point data is passed through the filter to the output.

// .SECTION See Also
// vtkVectorNorm
