// .NAME vtkCellDataToPointData - map cell data to point data
// .SECTION Description
// vtkCellDataToPointData is a filter that transforms cell data (i.e., data
// specified per cell) into point data (i.e., data specified at cell
// points). The method of transformation is based on averaging the data
// values of all cells using a particular point. Optionally, the input cell
// data can be passed through to the output as well.

// .SECTION Caveats
// This filter is an abstract filter, that is, the output is an abstract type
// (i.e., vtkDataSet). Use the convenience methods (e.g.,
// vtkGetPolyDataOutput(), GetStructuredPointsOutput(), etc.) to get the type
// of output you want.

// .SECTION See Also
// vtkDataSetToDataSetFilter vtkPointData vtkCellData vtkPointDataToCellData
