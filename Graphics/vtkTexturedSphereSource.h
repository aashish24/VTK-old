// .NAME vtkTexturedSphereSource - create a sphere centered at the origin
// .SECTION Description
// vtkTexturedSphereSource creates a polygonal sphere of specified radius 
// centered at the origin. The resolution (polygonal discretization) in both 
// the latitude (phi) and longitude (theta) directions can be specified. 
// It also is possible to create partial sphere by specifying maximum phi and 
// theta angles.
