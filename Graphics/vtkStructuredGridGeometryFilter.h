// .NAME vtkStructuredGridGeometryFilter - extract geometry for structured grid
// .SECTION Description
// vtkStructuredGridGeometryFilter is a filter that extracts geometry from a
// structured grid. By specifying appropriate i-j-k indices, it is possible
// to extract a point, a curve, a surface, or a "volume". Depending upon the
// type of data, the curve and surface may be curved or planar. The volume
// is actually a (n x m x o) region of points.
//
// The extent specification is zero-offset. That is, the first k-plane in
// a 50x50x50 structured grid is given by (0,49, 0,49, 0,0).

// .SECTION Caveats
// If you don't know the dimensions of the input dataset, you can use a large
// number to specify extent (the number will be clamped appropriately). For 
// example, if the dataset dimensions are 50x50x50, and you want a the fifth 
// k-plane, you can use the extents (0,100, 0,100, 4,4). The 100 will 
// automatically be clamped to 49.
