// .NAME vtkClipPolyData - clip polygonal data with user-specified implicit function
// .SECTION Description
// vtkClipPolyData is a filter that clips polygonal data to by a any subclass
// of vtkImplicitFunction. Clipping means that it actually "cuts" through
// the cells of the dataset, returning everthing inside of the specified 
// implicit function, including "pieces" of a cell. (Compare this with 
// vtkExtractGeometry, which pulls out entire, uncut cells.)
//
// To use this filter, at a minimum you need to specify an implicit
// function. You can also specify a implicit function value, which is
// used to decide what is inside and outside of the implicit
// function. You can also reverse the sense of what inside/outside is by
// setting the InsideOut instance variable. (The cutting algorithm
// proceeds by computing an implicit function value for each point in
// the dataset. This is compared to the implicit function value to
// determine inside/outside.)
//
// This filter can be configured to compute a second output. The
// second output is the polygonal data that is clipped away. Set the
// GenerateClippedData boolean on if you wish to access this output data.

// .SECTION Caveats
// In order to cut all types of cells in polygonal data, vtkClipPolyData
// triangulates some cells, and then cuts the resulting simplices
// (i.e., points, lines, and triangles). This means that the resulting 
// output may consist of different cell types than the input data.
