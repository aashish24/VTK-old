// .NAME vtkDashedStreamLine - generate constant-time dashed streamline in arbitrary dataset
// .SECTION Description
// vtkDashedStreamLine is a filter that generates a "dashed" streamline for 
// an arbitrary dataset. The streamline consists of a series of dashes, each 
// of which represents (approximately) a constant time increment. Thus, in the
// resulting visual representation, relatively long dashes represent areas of 
// high velocity, and small dashes represent areas of low velocity.
//
// vtkDashedStreamLine introduces the instance variable DashFactor. 
// DashFactor interacts with its superclass' instance variable StepLength to
// create the dashes. DashFactor is the percentage of the StepLength line 
// segment that is visible. Thus, if the DashFactor=0.75, the dashes will be 
// "three-quarters on" and "one-quarter off".

// .SECTION See Also

  // Description:
