// .NAME vlDashedStreamLine - generate constant-time dashed streamline in arbitrary dataset
// .SECTION Description
// vlStreamLine is a filter that generates a streamline for an arbitrary 
// dataset. The streamline consists of a series of dashes, each of which 
// represents a constant time increment. (A streamline is a line that is 
// everywhere tangent to the vector field (see vlStreamLine).

  // Description:
  // For each dash, specify the fraction of the dash that is "on". A factor
  // of 1.0 will result in a continuous line, a factor of 0.5 will result in
