// .NAME vtkGeometryFilter - extract geometry from data (or convert data to polygonal type)
// .SECTION Description
// vtkGeometryFilter is a general-purpose filter to extract geometry (and 
// associated data) from any type of dataset. Geometry is obtained as 
// follows: all 0D, 1D, and 2D cells are extracted. All 2D faces that are 
// used by only one 3D cell (i.e., boundary faces) are extracted. It is 
// also possible to specify conditions on point ids, cell ids, and on 
// bounding box (referred to as "Extent") to control the extraction process.
//
// This filter may be also used to convert any type of data to polygonal
// type. The conversion process may be less than satisfactory for some 3D
// datasets. For example, this filter will extract the outer surface of a 
// volume or structured grid dataset. (For structured data you may want to
// use vtkStructuredPointsGeometryFilter or vtkStructuredGridGeometryFilter).
// .SECTION Caveats
// When vtkGeometryFilter extracts cells (or boundaries of cells) it may create
// duplicate points. Use vtkCleanPolyData to merge duplicate points.
// .SECTION See Also
// vtkStructuredPointsGeometryFilter, vtkStructuredGridGeometryFilter
