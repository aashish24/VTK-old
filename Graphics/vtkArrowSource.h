// .NAME vtkArrowSource - Appends a cylinder to a cone to form an arrow.
// .SECTION Description
// vtkArrowSource was intended to be used as the source for a glyph.
// The shaft base is always at (0,0,0). The arrow tip is always at (1,0,0).
// The resolution of the cone and shaft can be set and default to 6.
// The radius of the cone and shaft can be set and default to 0.03 and 0.1.
// The length of the tip can also be set, and defaults to 0.35.
