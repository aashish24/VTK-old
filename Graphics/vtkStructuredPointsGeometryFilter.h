// .NAME vtkStructuredPointsGeometryFilter - extract geometry for structured points
// .SECTION Description
// vtkStructuredPointsGeometryFilter is a filter that extracts geometry from a
// structured points dataset. By specifying appropriate i-j-k indices (via the 
// "Extent" instance variable), it is possible to extract a point, a line, a 
// plane (i.e., image), or a "volume" from dataset. (Since the output is 
// of type polydata, the volume is actually a (n x m x o) region of points.)
//
// The extent specification is zero-offset. That is, the first k-plane in
// a 50x50x50 volume is given by (0,49, 0,49, 0,0).
// .SECTION Caveats
// If you don't know the dimensions of the input dataset, you can use a large
// number to specify extent (the number will be clamped appropriately). For 
// example, if the dataset dimensions are 50x50x50, and you want a the fifth 
// k-plane, you can use the extents (0,100, 0,100, 4,4). The 100 will 
// automatically be clamped to 49.
