// .NAME vtkExtractGeometry - extract cells that lie either entirely inside or outside of a specified implicit function

// .SECTION Description
// vtkExtractGeometry extracts from its input dataset all cells that are either
// completely inside or outside of a specified implicit function. Any type of
// dataset can be input to this filter. On output the filter generates an
// unstructured grid.

// .SECTION See Also
// vtkGeometryFilter vtkExtractVOI
