// .NAME vtkExtractGeometry - extract cells that lie either entirely inside or outside of a specified implicit function

// .SECTION Description
// vtkExtractGeometry extracts from its input dataset all cells that are either
// completely inside or outside of a specified implicit function. Any type of
// dataset can be input to this filter. On output the filter generates an
// unstructured grid.
//
// To use this filter you must specify an implicit function. You must also
// specify whethter to extract cells lying inside or outside of the implicit 
// function. (The inside of an implicit function is the negative values 
// region.) An option exists to extract cells that are neither inside or
// outside (i.e., boundary).
//
// A more efficient version of this filter is available for vtkPolyData input.
// See vtkExtractPolyDataGeometry.
