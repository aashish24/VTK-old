// .NAME vtkPlaneSource - create an array of quadrilaterals located in the plane
// .SECTION Description
// vtkPlaneSource creates an m x n array of quadrilaterals arranged as a
// regular tiling in the plane. The plane is centered at the origin, and 
// orthogonal to the global z-axis.  The resolution of the plane can be
// specified in both the x and y directions (i.e., specify m and n, 
// respectively).
