// .NAME vtkPlaneSource - create an array of quadrilaterals located in a plane
// .SECTION Description
// vtkPlaneSource creates an m x n array of quadrilaterals arranged as a
// regular tiling in a plane. The plane is defined by specifying an origin
// point, and then two other points that, together with the origin, define two
// axes for the plane. These axes do not have to be orthogonal - so you can 
// create a parallelogram. (The axes must not be parallel.) By default, the 
// plane is centered at the origin and perpendicular to the z-axis, with 
// width and height of length 1. The resolution of the plane (i.e., number 
// of subdivisions) is controlled by the ivars XResolution and YResolution.
//
// There are three conveience methods that allow you to easily move the plane. 
// The first, SetNormal(), allows you to specify the plane normal. The effect
// of this method is to rotate the plane around the center of the plane, 
// aligning the plane normal with the specified normal. The second, SetCenter(),
// translates the center of the plane to the specified center point. The third
// method, Push(), allows you to translate the plane along the plane normal by 
// the distance specified. (Negative Push values translate the plane in the 
// negative normal direction.)  Note that the SetNormal(), SetCenter() and Push() 
// methods modify the Origin, Point1, and/or Point2 ivars.

// .SECTION Caveats
// The normal to the plane will point in the direction of the cross product
// of the first axis (Origin->Point1) with the second (Origin->Point2). This
// also affects the normals to the generated polygons.
