// .NAME vtkAttributeDataToFieldDataFilter - map attribute data to field data
// .SECTION Description
// vtkAttributeDataToFieldDataFilter is a class that maps attribute data into
// field data. Since this filter is a subclass of vtkDataSetToDataSetFilter,
// the output dataset (whose structure is the same as the input dataset),
// will contain the field data that is generated. The filter will convert
// point and cell attribute data to field data and assign it as point and
// cell field data, replacing any point or field data that was there
// previously. By default, the original non-field point and cell attribute
// data will be passed to the output of the filter, although you can shut
// this behavior down.

// .SECTION Caveats
// Reference counting the underlying data arrays is used to create the field
// data.  Therefore, no extra memory is utilized.
//
// The original field data (if any) associated with the point and cell
// attribute data is placed into the generated fields along with the scalars,
// vectors, etc.
