// .NAME vtkRecursiveDividingCubes - create points lying on isosurface (using recursive approach)
// .SECTION Description
// vtkRecursiveDividingCubes is a filter that generates points lying on a 
// surface of constant scalar value (i.e., an isosurface). Dense point 
// clouds (i.e., at screen resolution) will appear as a surface. Less dense 
// clouds can be used as a source to generate streamlines or to generate 
// "transparent" surfaces.
//
// This implementation differs from vtkDividingCubes in that it uses a 
// recursive procedure. In many cases this can result in generating 
// more points than the procedural implementation of vtkDividingCubes. This is
// because the recursive procedure divides voxels by multiples of powers of 
// two. This can over-constrain subdivision. One of the advantages of the 
// recursive technique is that the recursion is terminated earlier, which in
// some cases can be more efficient.
