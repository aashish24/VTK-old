// .NAME vtkDelaunay2D - create 2D Delaunay triangulation of input points
// .SECTION Description
// vtkDelaunay2D is a filter that constructs a 2D Delaunay triangulation
// from a list of input points. These points may be represented by any 
// dataset of type vtkPointSet and subclasses. The output of the filter is
// a polygonal dataset. Usually the output is a triangle mesh, but if a
// non-zero alpha distance value is specified (called the "alpha" value),
// then only triangles, edges, and vertices lying within the alpha radius
// are output. In other words, non-zero alpha values may result in arbitrary
// combinations of triangles, lines, and vertices. (The notion of alpha 
// value is derived from Edelsbrunner's work on "alpha shapes".)
//
// The 2D Delaunay triangulation is defined as the triangulation that 
// satisfies the Delaunay criterion for n-dimensional simplexes (in this case
// n=2 and the simplexes are triangles). This criterion states that a 
// circumsphere of each simplex in a triangulation contains only the n+1 
// defining points of the simplex. (See text for more information.) In two
// dimensions, this translates into an optimal triangulation. That is, the
// maximum interior angle of any triangle is less than or equal to that of
// any possible triangulation.
// 
// Delaunay triangulations are used to build topological structures
// from unorganized (or unstructured) points. The input to this filter
// is a list of points specified in 3D, even though the triangulation
// is 2D. Thus the triangulation is constructed in the x-y plane, and
// the z coordinate is ignored (although carried through on
// output). (If you desire to triangulate in a different plane, you'll
// have to use the vtkTransformFilter to transform the points into and
// out of the x-y plane.)
// 
// The Delaunay triangulation can be numerically sensitive in some cases. To
// prevent problems, try to avoid injecting points that will result in
// triangles with bad aspect ratios (1000:1 or greater). In practice this
// means inserting points that are "widely dispersed", and enables smooth
// transition of triangle sizes throughout the mesh. (You may even want to
// add extra points to create a better point distribution.) If numerical
// problems are present, you will see a warning message to this effect at
// the end of the triangulation process.

// .SECTION Caveats
// Points arranged on a regular lattice (termed degenerate cases) can be 
// triangulated in more than one way (at least according to the Delaunay 
// criterion). The choice of triangulation (as implemented by 
// this algorithm) depends on the order of the input points. The first three
// points will form a triangle; other degenerate points will not break
// this triangle.
//
// Points that are coincident (or nearly so) may be discarded by the algorithm.
// This is because the Delaunay triangulation requires unique input points.
// You can control the definition of coincidence with the "Tolerance" instance
// variable.
//
// The output of the Delaunay triangulation is supposedly a convex hull. In 
// certain cases this implementation may not generate the convex hull. This
// behavior can be controlled by the Offset instance variable. Offset is a
// multiplier used to control the size of the initial triangulation. The 
// larger the offset value, the more likely you will generate a convex hull;
// and the more likely you are to see numerical problems.
