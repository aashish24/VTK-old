// .NAME vtkDelaunay2D - create 2D Delaunay triangulation of input points
// .SECTION Description
// vtkDelaunay2D is a filter that constructs a 2D Delaunay triangulation
// from a list of input points. These points may be represented by any 
// dataset of type vtkPointSet and subclasses. The output of the filter is
// a polygonal dataset. Usually the output is a triangle mesh, but if a
// non-zero alpha distance value is specified, then only triangles and edges
// lying within the alpha radius are output. In either words, non-zero 
// alpha values may result in mixtures of triangles, lines, and vertices.
//
// The 2D Delaunay triangulation is defined as the triangulation that 
// satisfies the Delaunay criterion for n-dimensional simplexes (in this case
// n=2 and the simplexes are triangles). This criterion states that a 
// circumsphere of each simplex in a triangulation contains only the n+1 
// defining points of the simplex. (See text for more information.) In two
// dimensions, this translates into an optimal triangulation. That is, the
// maximum interior angle of any triangle is less than or equal to that of
// any possible triangulation.
//
// Delaunay triangulations are used to build topological structures from 
// unorganized (or unstructured) points. The input to this filter is a list
// of points specified in 3D, even though the triangulation is 2D. To handle
// this, you must specify two out of three coordinates to use as the 2D 
// coordinate values. (Use the Plane instance variable.)
// .SECTION Caveats
// Points arranged on a regular lattice (termed degenerate cases) can be 
// triangulated in more than one way (at least according to the Delaunay 
// criterion). The choice of triangulation (as implemented by 
// this algorithm) depends on the order of the input points. The first three
// points will form a triangle; others degenerate points will not break
// this triangle.
//
// Points that are coincident (or nearly so) may be discarded by the algorithm.
// This is because the Delaunay triangulation requires  unique input points.
//
// The output of the Delaunay triangulation is supposedly a convex hull. In 
// certain cases this implementation may not generate the convex hull.
