// .NAME vtkPolyDataConnectivityFilter - extract polygonal data based on geometric connectivity
// .SECTION Description
// vtkPolyDataConnectivityFilter is a filter that extracts cells that share common 
// points. The filter works in one of four ways: 1) extract the largest
// connected region in the dataset; 2) extract specified region numbers;
// 3) extract all regions sharing specified point ids; or 4) extract
// all regions sharing specified cell ids.
//
// This filter is specialized for polygonal data. This means it runs a bit 
// faster and is easier to construct visualization networks that process
// polygonal data.
//
// The behavior of vtkPolyDataConnectivityFilter can be modified by turning on the 
// boolean ivar ScalarConnectivity. If this flag is on, the connectivity
// algorithm is modified so that cells are considered connected only if 1) they 
// are geometrically connected (share a vertex) and 2) the scalar values of one
// of the cell's points falls in the scalar range specified. This use of
// ScalarConnectivity is particularly useful for volume datasets: it can be used
// as a simple "connected segmentation" algorithm. For example, by using a seed
// voxel (i.e., cell) on a known anatomical structure, connectivity will pull
// out all voxels "containing" the anatomical structure. These voxels can then
// be contoured or processed by other visualization filters.
