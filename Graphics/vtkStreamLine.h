// .NAME vtkStreamLine - generate streamline in arbitrary dataset
// .SECTION Description
// vtkStreamLine is a filter that generates a streamline for an arbitrary 
// dataset. A streamline is a line that is everywhere tangent to the vector
// field. Scalar values are also calculated along the streamline and can be 
// used to color the line. Streamlines are calculated by integrating from
// a starting point through the vector field. Integration can be performed
// forward in time (see where the line goes), backward in time (see where the
// line came from), or in both directions. It is also possible to compute
// vorticity along the streamline. Vorticity is the projection (i.e., dot
// product) of the flow rotation on the velocity vector, i.e., the rotation
// of flow around the streamline.
//
// While the streamline representation is typically a line, it is also possible
// to generate a dashed line where the dash length is proportional to the 
// magnitude of the vector velocity.
