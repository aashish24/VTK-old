// .NAME vtkStreamLine - generate streamline in arbitrary dataset
// .SECTION Description
// vtkStreamLine is a filter that generates a streamline for an arbitrary 
// dataset. A streamline is a line that is everywhere tangent to the vector
// field. Scalar values also are calculated along the streamline and can be 
// used to color the line. Streamlines are calculated by integrating from
// a starting point through the vector field. Integration can be performed
// forward in time (see where the line goes), backward in time (see where the
// line came from), or in both directions. It also is possible to compute
// vorticity along the streamline. Vorticity is the projection (i.e., dot
// product) of the flow rotation on the velocity vector, i.e., the rotation
// of flow around the streamline.
//
// vtkStreamLine defines the instance variable StepLength. This parameter 
// controls the time increment used to generate individual points along
// the streamline(s). Smaller values result in more line 
// primitives but smoother streamlines. The StepLength instance variable is 
// defined in terms of time (i.e., the distance that the particle travels in
// the specified time period). Thus, the line segments will be smaller in areas
// of low velocity and larger in regions of high velocity. (NOTE: This is
// different than the IntegrationStepLength defined by the superclass
// vtkStreamer. IntegrationStepLength is used to control integration step 
// size and is expressed as a fraction of the cell length.) The StepLength
// instance variable is important because subclasses of vtkStreamLine (e.g.,
// vtkDashedStreamLine) depend on this value to build their representation.
