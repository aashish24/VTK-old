// .NAME vtkIdFilter - generate scalars or field data from point and cell ids
// .SECTION Description
// vtkIdFilter is a filter to that generates scalars or field data
// using cell and point ids. That is, the point attribute data scalars
// or field data are generated from the point ids, and the cell
// attribute data scalars or field data are generated from the the
// cell ids.
//
// Typically this filter is used with vtkLabeledDataMapper (and possibly
// vtkSelectVisiblePoints) to create labels for points and cells, or labels
// for the point or cell data scalar values.
