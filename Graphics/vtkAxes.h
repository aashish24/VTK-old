// .NAME vtkAxes - create an x-y-z axes
// .SECTION Description
// vtkAxes creates three lines that form an x-y-z axes. The origin of the
// axes is user specified (0,0,0 is default), and the size is specified with
// a scale factor. Three scalar values are generated for the three lines and
// can be used (via color map) to indicate a particular coordinate axis.
