// .NAME vtkWarpVector - deform geometry with vector data
// .SECTION Description
// vtkWarpVector is a filter that modifies point coordinates by moving
// points along vector times the scale factor. Useful for showing flow
// profiles or mechanical deformation.
//
// The filter passes both its point data and cell data to its output.
