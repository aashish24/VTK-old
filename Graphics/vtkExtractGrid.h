// .NAME vtkExtractGrid - select piece (e.g., volume of interest) and/or subsample structured grid dataset

// .SECTION Description
// vtkExtractGrid is a filter that selects a portion of an input structured
// grid dataset, or subsamples an input dataset. (The selected portion of
// interested is referred toas the Volume Of Interest, or VOI.) The output of
// this filter is a structured grid dataset. The filter treats input data of
// any topological dimension (i.e., point, line, image, or volume) and can
// generate output data of any topological dimension.
//
// To use this filter set the VOI ivar which are i-j-k min/max indices that
// specify a rectangular region in the data. (Note that these are 0-offset.)
// You can also specify a sampling rate to subsample the data.
//
// Typical applications of this filter are to extract a plane from a grid for 
// contouring, subsampling large grids to reduce data size, or extracting
// regions of a grid with interesting data.

  // or 3D grid).

  // Description:
  // Set the sampling rate in the i, j, and k directions. If the rate is > 1,
  // then the resulting VOI will be subsampled representation of the input.
  // For example, if the SampleRate=(2,2,2), every other point will be
  // selected, resulting in a volume 1/8th the original size.

  // Description:
  // Control whether to enforce that the "boundary" of the grid is output in
  // the subsampling process. (This ivar only has effect when the SampleRate
  // in any direction is not equal to 1.) When this ivar IncludeBoundary is
  // on, the subsampling will always include the boundary of the grid even
  // though the sample rate is not an even multiple of the grid
  // dimensions. (By default IncludeBoundary is off.)
