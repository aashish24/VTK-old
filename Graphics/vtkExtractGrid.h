// .NAME vtkExtractGrid - select piece (e.g., volume of interest) and/or subsample structured grid dataset

// .SECTION Description
// vtkExtractGrid is a filter that selects a portion of an input structured grid
// dataset, or subsamples an input dataset. (The selected portion of interested is
// referred toas the Volume Of Interest, or VOI.) The output of this filter is a 
// structured grid dataset. The filter treats input data of any topological
// dimension (i.e., point, line, image, or volume) and can generate output data 
// of any topological dimension.
//
// To use this filter set the VOI ivar which are i-j-k min/max indices that specify
// a rectangular region in the data. (Note that these are 0-offset.) You can also
// specify a sampling rate to subsample the data.
//
// Typical applications of this filter are to extract a plane from a grid for 
// contouring, subsampling large grids to reduce data size, or extracting
// regions of a grid with interesting data.

  // Description:
  // Set the sampling rate in the i, j, and k directions. If the rate is > 1, 
  // then the resulting VOI will be subsampled representation of the input. 
  // For example, if the SampleRate=(2,2,2), every other point will be selected,
  // resulting in a volume 1/8th the original size.
