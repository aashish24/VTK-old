// .NAME vtkMaskPoints - selectively filter points
// .SECTION Description
// vtkMaskPoints is a filter that passes through points and point attributes 
// from input dataset. (Other geometry is not passed through.) It is 
// possible to mask every nth point, and to specify an initial offset
// to begin masking from. A special random mode feature enables random 
// selection of points.
