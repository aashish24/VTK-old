// .NAME vtkStripper - create triangle strips
// .SECTION Description
// vtkStripper is a filter that generates triangle strips from input
// polygons and triangle strips. Input polygons are assumed to be 
// triangles. (Use vtkTriangleFilter to triangulate non-triangular
// polygons.) The filter will also pass through vertices and lines, if
// requested.
