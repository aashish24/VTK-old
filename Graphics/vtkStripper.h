// .NAME vtkStripper - create triangle strips and/or poly-lines
// .SECTION Description
// vtkStripper is a filter that generates triangle strips and/or poly-lines
// from input polygons, triangle strips, and lines. Input polygons are 
// assumed to be triangles. (Use vtkTriangleFilter to triangulate 
// non-triangular polygons.) The filter will pass through (to the output)
// vertices if they are present in the input poly-data.
//
// The ivar MaximumLength can be used to control the maximum
// allowable triangle strip and poly-line length.

// .SECTION Caveats
// If triangle strips or poly-lines exist in the input data they will
// be passed through to the output data. This filter will only construct
// triangle strips if triangle polygons are available; and will only 
// construct poly-lines if lines are available.

// .SECTION See Also
// vtkTriangleFilter
