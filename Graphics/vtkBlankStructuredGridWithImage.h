// .NAME vtkBlankStructuredGridWithImage - blank a structured grid with an image
// .SECTION Description
// This filter can be used to set the blanking in a structured grid with 
// an image. The filter takes two inputs: the structured grid to blank, 
// and the image used to set the blanking. Make sure that the dimensions of
// both the image and the structured grid are identical.
//
// Note that the image is interpreted as follows: zero values indicate that
// the structured grid point is blanked; non-zero values indicate that the
// structured grid point is visible. The blanking data must be unsigned char.

// .SECTION See Also
// vtkStructuredGrid
