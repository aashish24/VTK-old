// .NAME vtkHull - produce an n-sided convex hull
// .SECTION Description
// vtkHull is a filter which will produce an n-sided convex hull given a
// set of n planes. (The convex hull bounds the input polygonal data.) 
// The planes can be defined in a number of ways including manually 
// specifying each plane; choosing the six face planes of the input's
// bounding box; choosing the eight vertex planes of the input's
// bounding box; choosing the twelve edge planes of the input's
// bounding box; and/or using a recursively subdivided octahedron.
//
// The output of this filter can be used in combination with vtkLODActor 
// to represent a levels-of-detail in the LOD hierarchy.

  // Description:
  // Add the planes that represent the normals of the vertices of a polygonal
  // sphere formed by recursively subdividing the triangles in an octahedron.
  // Each triangle is subdivided by connecting the midpoints of the edges thus
  // forming 4 smaller triangles. The level indicates how many subdivisions to do
  // with a level of 0 used to add the 6 planes from the original octahedron, level
  // 1 will add 18 planes, and so on.
