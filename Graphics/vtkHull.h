// .NAME vtkHull - produce an n-sided convex hull
// .SECTION Description
// vtkHull is a filter which will produce an n-sided convex hull given a
// set of n planes. (The convex hull bounds the input polygonal data.)
// The hull is generated by squeezing the planes towards the input
// vtkPolyData, until the planes just touch the vtkPolyData. Then,
// the resulting planes are used to generate a polyhedron (i.e., hull)
// that is represented by triangles.
//
// The n planes can be defined in a number of ways including 1) manually 
// specifying each plane; 2) choosing the six face planes of the input's
// bounding box; 3) choosing the eight vertex planes of the input's
// bounding box; 4) choosing the twelve edge planes of the input's
// bounding box; and/or 5) using a recursively subdivided octahedron.
// Note that when specifying planes, the plane normals should point
// outside of the convex region.
//
// The output of this filter can be used in combination with vtkLODActor 
// to represent a levels-of-detail in the LOD hierarchy. Another use of
// this class is to manually specify the planes, and then generate the
// polyhedron from the planes (without squeezing the planes towards the
// input). The method GenerateHull() is used to do this.

  // Description:
  // Add a plane to the current set of planes. It will be added at the
  // end of the list, and an index that can later be used to set this
  // plane's normal will be returned. The values A, B, C are from the
  // plane equation Ax + By + Cz + D = 0. This vector does not have to
  // have unit length (but it must have a non-zero length!). If a value
  // 0 > i >= -NumberOfPlanes is returned, then the plane is parallel
  // with a previously inserted plane, and |-i-1| is the index of the

  // Add the planes that represent the normals of the vertices of a

  // in an octahedron.  Each triangle is subdivided by connecting the
  // midpoints of the edges thus forming 4 smaller triangles. The

  // A special method that is used to generate a polyhedron directly
  // from a set of n planes. The planes that are supplied by the user
  // are not squeezed towards the input data (in fact the user need
  // not specify an input). To use this method, you must provide an
  // instance of vtkPolyData into which the points and cells defining
  // the polyhedron are placed. You must also provide a bounding box
