// .NAME vtkConnectivityFilter - extract geometry based on geometric connectivity
// .SECTION Description
// vtkConnectivityFilter is a filter that extracts cells that share common 
// points. The filter works in one of four ways: 1) extract the largest
// connected region in the dataset, 2) extract specified region numbers,
// 3) extract all regions sharing specified point ids, and 4) extract
// all regions sharing specified cell ids.
