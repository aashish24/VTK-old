// .NAME vtkAppendFilter - appends one or more datasets together into a single unstructured grid
// .SECTION Description
// vtkAppendFilter is a filter that appends one of more datasets into a single
// unstructured grid. All geometry is extracted and appended, but point 
// attributes (i.e., scalars, vectors, normals, field data, etc.) are extracted 
// and appended only if all datasets have the point attributes available. 
// (For example, if one dataset has scalars but another does not, scalars will 
// not be appended.)

// .SECTION See Also
// vtkAppendPolyData
