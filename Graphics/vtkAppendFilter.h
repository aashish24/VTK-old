// .NAME vtkAppendFilter - appends one or more datasets together into a single unstructured grid
// .SECTION Description
// vtkAppendFilter is a filter that appends one of more datasets into a single
// unstructured grid. All geometry is extracted and appended, but point 
// attributes (i.e., scalars, vectors, normals) are extracted and appended
// only if all datasets have the point attributes available. (For example, 
// if one dataset has scalars but another does not, scalars will not be 
// appended.)
