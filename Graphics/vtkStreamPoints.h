// .NAME vtkStreamPoints - generate points along streamer separated by constant time increment
// .SECTION Description
// vtkStreamPoints is a filter that generates points along a streamer.
// The points are separated by a constant time increment. The resulting visual
// effect (especially when coupled with vtkGlyph3D) is an indication of 
// particle speed.

// .SECTION See Also
// vtkStreamer vtkStreamLine vtkDashedStreamLine
