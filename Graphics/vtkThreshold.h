// .NAME vtkThreshold - extracts cells where scalar value of every point in cell satisfies threshold criterion
// .SECTION Description
// vtkThreshold is a filter that extracts cells from any dataset type that 
// satisfy a threshold criterion. A cell satisfies the criterion if the 
// scalar value of every point satisfies the criterion. The criterion can 
// take three forms: 1) greater than a particular value; 2) less than a 
// particular value; or 3) between two values. The output of this filter
// is an unstructured grid.
