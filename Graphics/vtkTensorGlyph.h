// .NAME vtkTensorGlyph - scale and orient glyph according to tensor eigenvalues and eigenvectors
// .SECTION Description
// vtkTensorGlyph is a filter that copies a geometric representation (specified
// as polygonal data) to every input point. The geometric representation, or 
// glyph, can be scaled and/or rotated according to the tensor at the input 
// point. Scaling and rotation is controlled by the eigenvalues/eigenvectors
// of the tensor as follows. For each tensor, the eigenvalues (and associated
// eigenvectors) are sorted to determine the major, medium, and minor 
// eigenvalues/eigenvectors. The major eigenvalue scales the glyph in the 
// x-direction, the medium in the y-direction, and the minor in the 
// z-direction. Then, the glyph is rotated so that the glyph's local x-axis 
// lies along the major eigenvector, y-axis along the medium eigenvector, and
// z-axis along the minor.
//
// A scale factor is provided to control the amount of scaling. Also, you 
// can turn off scaling completely if desired. The boolean variable 
// ClampScaling controls the maximum scaling (in conjunction with
// MaxScaleFactor.) This is useful in certain applications where 
// singularities or large order of magnitude differences exist in 
// the eigenvalues.
//
// Another instance variable, ExtractEigenvalues, has been provided to 
// control extraction of eigenvalues/eigenvectors. If this boolean is false,
// then eigenvalues/eigenvectors are not extracted, and the columns of the
// tensor are taken as the eigenvectors (norm of column is eigenvalue). 
// This allows additional capability over the vtkGlyph3D object. That is, the
// glyph can be oriented in three directions instead of one.
