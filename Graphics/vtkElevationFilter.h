// .NAME vtkElevationFilter - generate scalars along a specified direction
// .SECTION Description
// vtkElevationFilter is a filter to generate scalar values from a dataset.
// The scalar values lie within a user specified range, and are generated
// by computing a projection of each dataset point onto a line. The line
// can be oriented arbitrarily. A typical example is to generate scalars
// based on elevation or height above a plane.
