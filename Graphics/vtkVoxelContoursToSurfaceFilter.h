// .NAME vtkVoxelContoursToSurfaceFilter - create surface from contours
// .SECTION Description
// vtkVoxelContoursToSurfaceFilter is a filter that takes contours and
// produces surfaces. There are some restrictions for the contours:
//
//   - The contours are input as vtkPolyData, with the contours being
//     polys in the vtkPolyData.
//   - The contours lie on XY planes - each contour has a constant Z
//   - The contours are ordered in the polys of the vtkPolyData such 
//     that all contours on the first (lowest) XY plane are first, then
//     continuing in order of increasing Z value. 
//   - The X, Y and Z coordinates are all integer values.
//   - The desired sampling of the contour data is 1x1x1 - Aspect can
//     be used to control the aspect ratio in the output polygonal
//     dataset.
//
// This filter takes the contours and produces a structured points
// dataset of signed floating point number indicating distance from
// a contour. A contouring filter is then applied to generate 3D
// surfaces from a stack of 2D contour distance slices. This is 
// done in a streaming fashion so as not to use to much memory.
