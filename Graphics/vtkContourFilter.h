// .NAME vtkContourFilter - generate isosurfaces/isolines from scalar values
// .SECTION Description
// vtkContourFilter is a filter that takes as input any dataset and 
// generates on output isosurfaces and/or isolines. The exact form 
// of the output depends upon the dimensionality of the input data. 
// Data consisting of 3D cells will generate isosurfaces, data 
// consisting of 2D cells will generate isolines, and data with 1D 
// or 0D cells will generate isopoints. Combinations of output type 
// are possible if the input dimension is mixed.
//
// If the input type is volume (e.g., 3D structured point dataset), 
// you may wish to use vtkMarchingCubes. This class is specifically tailored
// for volumes and is therefore much faster.
// .SECTION Caveats
// vtkContourFilter uses variations of marching cubes to generate output
// primitives. The output primitives are disjoint - that is, points may
// be generated that are coincident but distinct. You may want to use
// vtkCleanPolyData to remove the coincident points. Also, the isosurface
// is not generated with surface normals. Use vtkPolyNormals to create them,
// if desired.
