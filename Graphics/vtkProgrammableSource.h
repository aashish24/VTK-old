// .NAME vtkProgrammableSource - generate source dataset via a user-specified function
// .SECTION Description
// vtkProgrammableSource is a source object that is programmable by the
// user. To use this object, you must specify a function that creates the
// output.  It is possible to generate an output dataset of any (concrete) 
// type; it is up to the function to properly initialize and define the 
// output. Typically, you use one of the methods to get a concrete output 
// type (e.g., GetPolyDataOutput() or GetStructuredPointsOutput()), and 
// then manipulate the output in the user-specified function.
//
// Example use of this include writing a function to read a data file or
// interface to another system. (You might want to do this in favor of
// deriving a new class.) Another important use of this class is that it
// allows users of interpreters (e.g., Tcl or Java) the ability to write
// source objects without having to recompile C++ code or generate new
// libraries.
