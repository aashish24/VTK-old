// .NAME vtkMergeDataObjectFilter - merge dataset and data object field to create dataset with attribute data
// .SECTION Description
// vtkMergeDataObjectFilter is a filter that merges the field from a 
// vtkDataObject with a vtkDataSet. The resulting combined dataset can then
// be processed by other filters (e.g., vtkFieldDataToAttributeDataFilter)
// to create attribute data like scalars, vectors, etc.
//
// The filter operates as follows. The field data from the vtkDataObject is
// merged with the input's vtkDataSet and then placed in the output. You can
// choose to place the field data into the cell data field, the point data field,
// or the datasets field (i.e., the one inherited from vtkDataSet's
// superclass vtkDataObject). All this data shuffling occurs via reference
// counting, therefore memory is not copied.
//
// One of the uses of this filter is to allow you to read/generate the
// structure of a dataset independent of the attributes. So, for example, you
// could store the dataset geometry/topology in one file, and field data in
// another. Then use this filter in combination with
// vtkFieldDataToAttributeData to create a dataset ready for processing in
// the visualization pipeline.
