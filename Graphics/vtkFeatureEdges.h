// .NAME vtkFeatureEdges - extract boundary, non-manifold, and/or sharp edges from polygonal data
// .SECTION Description
// vtkFeatureEdges is a filter to extract special types of edges from
// input polygonal data. These edges are either 1) boundary (used by 
// one polygon) or a line cell; 2) non-manifold (used by three or more 
// polygons); 3) feature edges (edges used by two triangles and whose
// dihedral angle > FeatureAngle); or 4) manifold edges (edges used by
// exactly two polygons). These edges may be extracted in any
// combination. Edges may also be "colored" (i.e., scalar values assigned)
// based on edge type. The cell coloring is assigned to the cell data of
// the extracted edges.

// .SECTION Caveats
// To see the coloring of the liens you may have to set the ScalarMode
// instance variable of the mapper to SetScalarModeToUseCellData(). (This
// is only a problem if there are point data scalars.)

// .SECTION See Also
// vtkFeatureVertices
