// .NAME vtkDataSetTriangleFilter - triangulate any type of dataset
// .SECTION Description
// vtkTriangulateDataSet generates n-dimensional simplices from any input
// dataset. That is, 3D cells are converted to tetrahedral meshes, 2D cells
// to triangles, and so on. The triangulation is guaranteed compatible as
// long as the dataset is either zero-, one- or two-dimensional; or if
// a three-dimensional dataset, all cells in the 3D dataset are convex 
// with planar facets.
//
// .SECTION See Also
// vtkOrderedTriangulator vtkTriangleFilter
