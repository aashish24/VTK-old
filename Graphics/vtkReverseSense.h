// .NAME vtkReverseSense - reverse the ordering of polygonal cells and/or vertex normals
// .SECTION Description
// 
// vtkReverseSense is a filter that reverses the order of polygonal cells
// and/or reverses the direction of point and cell normals. Two flags are
// used to control these operations. Cell reversal means reversing the order
// of indices in the cell connectivity list. Normal reversal means
// multiplying the normal vector by -1 (both point and cell normals, 
// if present).

// .SECTION Caveats
// Normals can be operated on only if they are present in the data.
