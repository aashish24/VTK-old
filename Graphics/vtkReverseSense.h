// .NAME vtkReverseSense - reverse the ordering of polygonal cells and/or vertex normals
// .SECTION Description
// vtkReverseSense is a filter that reverses the order of polygonal cells
// and/or reverses the direction of vertex normals. Two flags are used to
// control these operations. Cell reversal means reversing the order of 
// indices in the cell connectivity list. Normal reversal means multiplying
// the normal vector by -1.

// .SECTION Caveats
// Normals can be operated on only if they are present in the data.
