// .NAME vtkDecimatePro - reduce the number of triangles in a mesh
// .SECTION Description
// vtkDecimatePro is a filter to reduce the number of triangles in a triangle 
// mesh, forming a good approximation to the original geometry. The input to 
// vtkDecimatePro is a vtkPolyData object, and only triangles are treated. If 
// you desire to decimate polygonal meshes, first triangulate the polygons
// with vtkTriangleFilter object.
// 
// The implementation of vtkDecimatePro is similar to the algorithm
// originally described in "Decimation of Triangle Meshes", Proc Siggraph
// `92, with three major differences. First, this algorithm does not
// necessarily preserve the topology of the mesh. Second, it is guaranteed to
// give the a mesh reduction factor specified by the user (as long as certain
// contraints are not set - see Caveats). Third, it is set up generate
// progressive meshes, that is a stream of operations that can be easily
// transmitted and incrementally updated (see Hugues Hoppe's Siggraph '96
// paper on progressive meshes).
// 
// The algorithm proceeds as follows. Each vertex in the mesh is classified
// and inserted into a priority queue. The priority is based on the error to
// delete the vertex and retriangulate the hole. Vertices that cannot be
// deleted or triangulated (at this point in the algorithm) are
// skipped. Then, each vertex in the priority queue is processed (i.e.,
// deleted followed by hole triangulation using edge collapse). This
// continues until the priority queue is empty. Next, all remaining vertices
// are processed, and the mesh is split into separate pieces along sharp
// edges or at non-manifold attachment points and reinserted into the
// priority queue. Again, the priority queue is processed until empty. If
// the desired reduction is still not achieved, the remaining vertices are
// split as necessary (in a recursive fashion) so that it is possible to
// eliminate every triangle as necessary.
// 
// To use this object, at a minimum you need to specify the ivar
// TargetReduction. The algorithm is guaranteed to generate a reduced mesh
// at this level as long as the following four conditions are met: 1)
// topology modification is allowed (i.e., the ivar PreserveTopology is off);
// 2) mesh splitting is enabled (i.e., the ivar Splitting is on); 3) the
// algorithm is allowed to modify the boundary of the mesh (i.e., the ivar
// BoundaryVertexDeletion is on); and 4) the maximum allowable error (i.e.,
// the ivar MaximumError) is set to VTK_LARGE_FLOAT.  Other important
// parameters to adjust include the FeatureAngle and SplitAngle ivars, since
// these can impact the quality of the final mesh. Also, you can set the
// ivar AccumulateError to force incremental error update and distribution
// to surrounding vertices as each vertex is deleted. The accumulated error
// is a conservative global error bounds and decimation error, but requires
// additional memory and time to compute.

// .SECTION Caveats
// To guarantee a given level of reduction, the ivar PreserveTopology must
// be off; the ivar Splitting is on; the ivar BoundaryVertexDeletion is on;
// and the ivar MaximumError is set to VTK_LARGE_FLOAT.
//
// If PreserveTopology is off, and SplitEdges is off; the mesh topology may
// be modified by closing holes.
//
// Once mesh splitting begins, the feature angle is set to the split angle.

  // Description:
  // Create object with specified reduction of 90% and feature angle of
  // 15 degrees. Edge splitting is on, defer splitting is on, and the
  // split angle is 75 degrees. Topology preservation is off, delete
  // boundary vertices is on, and the maximum error is set to
  // VTK_LARGE_FLOAT. The inflection point ratio is 10 and the vertex
  // degree is 25. Error accumulation is turned off.
  static vtkDecimatePro *New() {return new vtkDecimatePro;};

  // Description:
  // Specify the desired reduction in the total number of polygons. Because
  // of various constraints, this level of reduction may not be realized. If
  // you want to guarantee a particular reduction, you must turn off 
  // PreserveTopology and BoundaryVertexDeletion, turn on SplitEdges,
  // and set the MaximumError to VTK_LARGE_FLOAT (these ivars are initialized 
  // this way when the object is instantiated).
  vtkSetClampMacro(TargetReduction,float,0.0,1.0);
  vtkGetMacro(TargetReduction,float);

  // Description:
  // Turn on/off whether to preserve the topology of the original mesh. If
  // on, mesh splitting and hole elimination will not occur. This may limit
  // the maximumm reduction that may be achieved.
  vtkSetMacro(PreserveTopology,int);
  vtkGetMacro(PreserveTopology,int);
  vtkBooleanMacro(PreserveTopology,int);

  // Description:
  // Specify the mesh feature angle. This angle is used to define what
  // an edge is (i.e., if the surface normal between two adjacent triangles
  // is >= FeatureAngle, an edge exists).
  vtkSetClampMacro(FeatureAngle,float,0.0,180.0);
  vtkGetMacro(FeatureAngle,float);

  // Description:
  // Turn on/off the splitting of the mesh at corners, along edges, at
  // non-manifold points, or anywhere else a split is required. Turning 
  // splitting off will better preserve the original topology of the
  // mesh, but you may not obtain the requested reduction.

  vtkBooleanMacro(Splitting,int);

  // Description:
  // Specify the mesh split angle. This angle is used to control the splitting
  // of the mesh. A split line exists when the surface normals between
  // two edge connected triangles are >= SplitAngle.
  vtkSetClampMacro(SplitAngle,float,0.0,180.0);
  vtkGetMacro(SplitAngle,float);

  // Description:
  // In some cases you may wish to split the mesh prior to algorithm
  // execution. This separates the mesh into semi-planar patches, which are
  // disconnected from each other. This can give superior results in some
  // cases. If the ivar PreSplitMesh ivar is enabled, the mesh is split with
  // the specified SplitAngle. Otherwise mesh splitting is deferred as long
  // as possible.

  // Description:
  // Set the largest decimation error that is allowed during the decimation
  // process. This may limit the maximum reduction that may be achieved. The
  // maximum error is specified as a fraction of the maximum length of
  // the input data bounding box.
  vtkSetClampMacro(MaximumError,float,0.0,VTK_LARGE_FLOAT);
  vtkGetMacro(MaximumError,float);

  // Description:
  // The computed error can either be computed directly from the mesh
  // or the error may be accumulated as the mesh is modified. If the error
  // is accumulated, then it represents a global error bounds, and the ivar
  // MaximumError becomes a global bounds on mesh error. Accumulating the
  // error requires extra memory proportional to the number of vertices in
  // the mesh. If AccumulateError is off, then the error is not accumulated.

  // Description:
  // Turn on/off the deletion of vertices on the boundary of a mesh. This
  // may limit the maximum reduction that may be achieved.
  vtkSetMacro(BoundaryVertexDeletion,int);
  vtkGetMacro(BoundaryVertexDeletion,int);
  vtkBooleanMacro(BoundaryVertexDeletion,int);

  // Description:
  // If the number of triangles connected to a vertex exceeds "Degree", then
  // the vertex will be split. (NOTE: the complexity of the triangulation
  // algorithm is proportional to Degree^2. Setting degree small can improve
  // the performance of the algorithm.)

  // Description:
  // Specify the inflection point ratio. An inflection point occurs
  // when the ratio of reduction error between two iterations is greaten
  // than or equal to the InflectionPointRatio.
  vtkSetClampMacro(InflectionPointRatio,float,1.001,VTK_LARGE_FLOAT);

  // Description:
  // Get the number of inflection points. Only returns a valid value after
  // the filter has executed.  The values in the list are mesh reduction
  // values at each inflection point. Note: the first inflection point always
  // occurs right before non-planar triangles are decimated (i.e., as the
  // error becomes non-zero).
  int GetNumberOfInflectionPoints();

  // Description:
  // Get a list of inflection points. These are float values 0 < r <= 1.0 
  // corresponding to reduction level, and there are a total of
  // NumberOfInflectionPoints() values. You must provide an array (of
  // the correct size) into which the inflection points are written.
