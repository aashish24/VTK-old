// .NAME vtkDecimatePro - reduce the number of triangles in a triangle mesh (and generate progressive meshes)
// .SECTION Description
// vtkDecimatePro is a filter to reduce the number of triangles in a triangle 
// mesh, forming a good approximation to the original geometry. The input to 
// vtkDecimatePro is a vtkPolyData object, and only triangles are treated. If 
// you desire to decimate polygonal meshes, first triangulate the polygons
// with vtkTriangleFilter object.
// 
// The implementation of vtkDecimatePro is similar to vtkDecimate,
// with three major differences. First, this algorithm does not
// necessarily preserve the topology of the mesh. Second, it is
// guaranteed to give the a mesh reduction factor specified by the
// user. Third, it is set up generate progressive meshes, that is a
// stream of operations that can be easily transmitted and
// incrementally updated (see Hugues Hoppe's Siggraph '96 paper on
// progressive meshes).

  // is >= FeatureAngle, an edge exists).

  vtkGetMacro(FeatureAngle,float);

  // Description:
  // Turn on/off the splitting of the mesh at corners, along edges, at

  // splitting off will preserve the original topology of the mesh, but you

  // Description:

  // requested reduction value. An operation is something like an edge
  // collapse or vertex split that modifies the mesh. The number of
  // operations is valid only after the filter has executed.
