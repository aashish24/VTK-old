// .NAME vtkDecimatePro - reduce the number of triangles in a triangle mesh (and generate progressive meshes)
// .SECTION Description
// vtkDecimatePro is a filter to reduce the number of triangles in a triangle 
// mesh, forming a good approximation to the original geometry. The input to 
// vtkDecimatePro is a vtkPolyData object, and only triangles are treated. If 
// you desire to decimate polygonal meshes, first triangulate the polygons
// with vtkTriangleFilter object.
// 
// The implementation of vtkDecimatePro is similar to vtkDecimate,
// with three major differences. First, this algorithm does not
// necessarily preserve the topology of the mesh. Second, it is
// guaranteed to give the a mesh reduction factor specified by the
// user (if Splitting is on). Third, it is set up generate progressive
// meshes, that is a stream of operations that can be easily transmitted and
// incrementally updated (see Hugues Hoppe's Siggraph '96 paper on
// progressive meshes).
// 
// The algorithm proceeds as follows. Each vertex in the mesh is classified and
// inserted into a priority queue. The priority is based on the error to
// delete the vertex and retriangulate the hole. Vertices that cannot be
// deleted or triangulated at this point are skipped. Then, each vertex in
// the priority queue is processed (i.e., deleted followed by hole
// triangulation). This continues until the priority queue is empty. Next,
// all vertices are processed, and the mesh is split into separate
// pieces. The vertices are then again reinserted into the priority queue,
// but this time as they are processed, vertices that cannot be triangulated
// are split (possibly recursively). This continues until the requested
// reduction level is achieved.
// 
// To use this object, at a minimum you need to specify the ivar Reduction. The
// algorithm is guaranteed to generate a reduced mesh at this level, unless
// the ivar Splitting is turned off. (Splitting prevents the separation of the mesh
// into separate pieces, so topological contraints may prevent the algorithm
// from realizing the requested reduction.) You may also wish to adjust the
// FeatureAngle and SplitAngle ivars, since these can impact the quality of
// the final mesh.

// .SECTION Caveats
// Do not use this class if you need to preserve the topology of the
// mesh. Even with splitting turned off, holes may be closed or non-manifold
// attachments may be formed. Use vtkDecimate instead.
