// .NAME vtkEdgePoints - generate points on isosurface
// .SECTION Description
// vtkEdgePoints is a filter that takes as input any dataset and 
// generates for output a set of points that lie on an isosurface. The 
// points are created by interpolation along cells edges whose end-points are 
// below and above the contour value.
// .SECTION Caveats
// vtkEdgePoints can be considered a "poor man's" dividing cubes algorithm
// (see vtkDividingCubes). Points are generated only on the edges of cells, 
// not in the interior, and at lower density than dividing cubes. However, it 
// is more general than dividing cubes since it treats any type of dataset.
