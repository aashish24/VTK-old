// .NAME vtkFrustumExtractor - Returns the portion of the input dataset that 
// lies within a selection frustum.
//
// .SECTION Description
// This class intersects the input DataSet with a frustum and determines which
// cells and points lie within the frustum. The frustum is defined with a 
// vtkPlanes containing six cutting planes. The output is a DataSet, that is 
// either a shallow copy of the input dataset with two new "vtkInsidedness" 
// attribute arrays, or a completely new UnstructuredGrid that contains only 
// the cells and points of the input that are inside the frustum. The 
// PassThrough Flag controls which occurs.
//
// You have two choices for what cells are considered to be inside.
// IncludePartialOff treats a cell as inside only if all of its points are 
// inside. This is equivalent to the inside only mode of vtkExtractGeometry 
// filter. IncludePartialOn treats a cell as inside if any part of it is 
// inside. Points are considered to be inside if they are part of an inside 
// cell. An example is a line segment that crosses the frustum but has both
// vertices outside.
