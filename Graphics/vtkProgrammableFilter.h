// .NAME vtkProgrammableFilter - a user-programmable filter
// .SECTION Description
// vtkProgrammableFilter is a filter that can be programmed by the user.  To
// use the filter you define a function that retrieves input of the correct
// type, creates data, and then manipulates the output of the filter.  Using
// this filter avoids the need for subclassing - and the function can be
// defined in an interpreter wrapper language such as Tcl or Java.
//
// The trickiest part of using this filter is that the input and output
// methods are unusual and cannot be compile-time type checked. Instead, as a
// user of this filter it is your responsibility to set and get the correct
// input and output types.

// .SECTION Caveats
// The filter correctly manages modified time and network execution in most
// cases. However, if you change the definition of the filter function,
// you'll want to send a manual Modified() method to the filter to force it
// to reexecute.

// .SECTION See Also

  // Description:
  // Get the input as a concrete type. This method is typically used by the
  // writer of the filter function to get the input as a particular type (i.e.,
  // it essentially does type casting). It is the users responsibility to know
  // the correct type of the input data.
