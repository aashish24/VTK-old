// .NAME vtkProgrammableGlyphFilter - control the generation and placement of glyphs at input points
// .SECTION Description
// vtkProgrammableGlyphFilter is a filter that allows you to place a glyph at
// each input point in the dataset. In addition, the filter is programmable
// which means the user has control over the generation of the glyph. The
// glyphs can be controlled via the point data attributes (e.g., scalars,
// vectors, etc.) or any other information in the input dataset.
//
// This is the way the filter works. You must define an input dataset which
// at a minimum contains points with associated attribute values. Also, the
// Source instance variable must be set which is of type vtkPolyData. Then,
// for each point in the input, the PointId is set to the current point id,
// and a user-defined function is called (i.e., GlyphMethod). In this method
// you can manipulate the Source data (including changing to a different
// Source object). After the GlyphMethod is called,
// vtkProgrammableGlyphFilter will invoke an Update() on its Source object,
// and then copy its data to the output of the
// vtkProgrammableGlyphFilter. Therefore the output of this filter is of type
// vtkPolyData.
//
// Another option to this filter is the way you color the glyphs. You can use
// the scalar data from the input or the source. The instance variable
// ColorMode controls this behavior.

// .SECTION Caveats
// This filter operates on point data attributes. If you want to use cell
// data attributes, use a filter like vtkCellCenters to generate points at
// the centers of cells, and then use these points.
//
// Note that the data attributes (cell and point) are passed to the output of
// this filter from the Source object. This works well as long as you are not
// changing the class of the Source object during execution. However, if the
// class of the Source object changes, then the potential exists that the
// data attributes might change during execution (e.g., scalars available
// from one source and not the next), possibly fouling up the copying of data
// attributes to the output. In this case, you may have to manually set the
// output's copy flags (e.g., CopyScalarsOn/Off(), CopyVectorsOn/Off(), etc.)
// to control what's being copied.
