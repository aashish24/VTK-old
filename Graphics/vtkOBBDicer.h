// .NAME vtkOBBDicer - divide dataset into spatially aggregated pieces
// .SECTION Description
// vtkOBBDicer separates the cells of a dataset into spatially
// aggregated pieces using a Oriented Bounding Box (OBB). These pieces
// can then be operated on by other filters (e.g., vtkThreshold). One
// application is to break very large polygonal models into pieces and
// performing viewing and occlusion culling on the pieces.
//
// Refer to the superclass documentation (vtkDicer) for more information.

// .SECTION See Also
// vtkDicer vtkConnectedDicer
