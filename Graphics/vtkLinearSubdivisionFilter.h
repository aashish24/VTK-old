// .NAME vtkLinearSubdivisionFilter - generate a subdivision surface using the Linear Scheme
// .SECTION Description
// vtkLinearSubdivisionFilter is a filter that geneartes output by
// subdividing its input polydata. Each subdivision iteration create 4
// new triangles for each triangle in the polydata.
