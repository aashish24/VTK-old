// .NAME vtkTransformFilter - transform points and associated normals and vectors
// .SECTION Description
// vtkTransformFilter is a filter to transform point coordinates, and 
// associated point normals and vectors. Other point data is passed
// through the filter.
//
// An alternative method of transformation is to use vtkActor's methods
// to scale, rotate, and translate objects. The difference between the
// two methods is that vtkActor's transformation simply effects where
// objects are rendered (via the graphics pipeline), whereas
// vtkTransformFilter actually modifies point coordinates in the 
// visualization pipeline. This is necessary for some objects 
// (e.g., vtkProbeFilter) that require point coordinates as input.

// .SECTION See Also
