// .NAME vtkDiskSource - create a disk with hole in center
// .SECTION Description
// vtkDiskSource creates a polygonal disk with a hole in the center. The 
// disk has zero height. The user can specify the inner and outer radius
// of the disk, and the radial and circumferential resolution of the 
// polygonal representation. 
// .SECTION SEE ALSO
// vtkLinearExtrusionFilter
