// .NAME vtkSpatialRepresentationFilter - generate polygonal model of spatial search object (i.e., a vtkLocator)
// .SECTION Description
// vtkSpatialRepresentationFilter generates an polygonal representation of a
// spatial search (vtkLocator) object. The representation varies depending
// upon the nature of the spatial search object. For example, the
// representation for vtkOBBTree is a collection of oriented bounding
// boxes. Ths input to this filter is a dataset of any type, and the output
// is polygonal data. You must also specify the spatial search object to
// use.
//
// Generally spatial search objects are used for collision detection and other 
// geometric operations, but in this filter one or more levels of spatial 
// searchers can be generated to form a geometric approximation to the 
// input data. This is a form of data simplification, generally used to 
// accelerate the rendering process. Or, this filter can be used as a debugging/
// visualization aid for spatial search objects.
// 
// This filter can generate one or more output vtkPolyData corresponding to
// different levels in the spatial search tree. The output data is retrieved 
// using the GetOutput(id) method, where id ranges from 0 (root level) 
// to Level. Note that the output for level "id" is not computed unless a 
// GetOutput(id) method is issued. Thus, if you desire three levels of output 
// (say 2,4,7), you would have to invoke GetOutput(2), GetOutput(4), and 
// GetOutput(7). (Also note that the Level ivar is computed automatically 
// depending on the size and nature of the input data.) There is also 
// another GetOutput() method that takes no parameters. This method returns 
// the leafs of the spatial search tree, which may be at different levels.

// .SECTION Caveats
// You can specify the number of levels of to generate with the MaxLevels
// ivar. However, when the spatial search tree is built, this number of levels 
// may not actually be generated. The actual number available can be found in 
// the Levels ivar. Note that the value of Levels may change after filter
// execution.
