// .NAME vtkQuantizePolyDataPoints - quantizes x,y,z coordinates of points
// .SECTION Description
// vtkQuantizePolyDataPoints is a subclass of vtkCleanPolyData and
// inherits the functionality of vtkCleanPolyData with the addition that
// it quantizes the point coordinates before inserting into the point list.
// The user should set QFactor to a positive value (0.25 by default) and all
// {x,y,z} coordinates will be quantized to that grain size.
//
// A tolerance of zero is expected, though positive values may be used, the
// quantization will take place before the tolerance is applied.
//
// .SECTION Caveats
// Merging points can alter topology, including introducing non-manifold
// forms. Handling of degenerate cells is controlled by switches in
// vtkCleanPolyData.
//
// .SECTION See Also
// vtkCleanPolyData
