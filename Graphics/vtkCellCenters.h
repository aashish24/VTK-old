// .NAME vtkCellCenters - generate points at center of cells
// .SECTION Description
// vtkCellCenters is a filter that takes as input any dataset and 
// generates on output points at the center of the cells in the dataset.
// These points can be used for placing glyphs (vtkGlyph3D) or labeling 
// (vtkLabeledDataMapper). (The center is the parametric center of the
// cell, not necessarily the geometric or bounding box center.) The cell
// attributes will be associated with the points on output.
// 
// .SECTION Caveats
// You can choose to generate just points or points and vertex cells.
// Vertex cells are drawn during rendering; points are not. Use the ivar
// VertexCells to generate cells.

// .SECTION See Also
// vtkGlyph3D vtkLabeledDataMapper
