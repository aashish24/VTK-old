// .NAME vtkMassProperties - estimate volume, area, shape index of triangle mesh
// .SECTION Description
// vtkMassProperties estimates the volume, the surface area, and the
// normalized shape index of a model.  The algorithm implemented here is
// based on the discrete form of the divergence theorem.  The general
// assumption here is that the model is of closed surface.  For more
// details see the following reference (Alyassin A.M. et al, "Evaluation
// of new algorithms for the interactive measurement of surface area and
// volume", Med Phys 21(6) 1994.).
// NOTE: currently only triangles are processed. Use vtkTriangleFilter
// to convert any strips or polygons to triangles.
