// .NAME vtkDelaunay3D - create 3D Delaunay triangulation of input points
// .SECTION Description

// vtkDelaunay3D is a filter that constructs a 3D Delaunay
// triangulation from a list of input points. These points may be
// represented by any dataset of type vtkPointSet and subclasses. The
// output of the filter is an unstructured grid dataset. Usually the
// output is a tetrahedral mesh, but if a non-zero alpha distance
// value is specified (called the "alpha" value), then only tetrahedra,
// triangles, edges, and vertices lying within the alpha radius are 
// output. In other words, non-zero alpha values may result in arbitrary
// combinations of tetrahedra, triangles, lines, and vertices. (The notion 
// of alpha value is derived from Edelsbrunner's work on "alpha shapes".)
// 
// The 3D Delaunay triangulation is defined as the triangulation that
// satisfies the Delaunay criterion for n-dimensional simplexes (in
// this case n=3 and the simplexes are tetrahedra). This criterion
// states that a circumsphere of each simplex in a triangulation
// contains only the n+1 defining points of the simplex. (See text for
// more information.) While in two dimensions this translates into an
// "optimal" triangulation, this is not true in 3D, since a measurement 
// for optimality in 3D is not agreed on.
//
// Delaunay triangulations are used to build topological structures
// from unorganized (or unstructured) points. The input to this filter
// is a list of points specified in 3D. (If you wish to create 2D 
// triangulations see vtkDelaunay2D.) The output is an unstructured grid.

// .SECTION Caveats
// Points arranged on a regular lattice (termed degenerate cases) can be 
// triangulated in more than one way (at least according to the Delaunay 
// criterion). The choice of triangulation (as implemented by 
// this algorithm) depends on the order of the input points. The first four
// points will form a tetrahedron; other degenerate points (relative to this
// initial tetrahedron) will not break it.
//
// Points that are coincident (or nearly so) may be discarded by the
// algorithm.  This is because the Delaunay triangulation requires
// unique input points.  You can control the definition of coincidence
// with the "Tolerance" instance variable.
//
// The output of the Delaunay triangulation is supposedly a convex hull. In 
// certain cases this implementation may not generate the convex hull. This
// behavior can be controlled by the Offset instance variable. Offset is a
// multiplier used to control the size of the initial triangulation. The 
// larger the offset value, the more likely you will generate a convex hull;
// and the more likely you are to see numerical problems.
//
// The implementation of this algorithm varies from the 2D Delaunay
// algorithm (i.e., vtkDelaunay2D) in an important way. When points are
// injected into the triangulation, the search for the enclosing tetrahedron
// is quite different. In the 3D case, the closest previously inserted point
// point is found, and then the connected tetrahedra are searched to find
// the containing one. (In 2D, a "walk" towards the enclosing triangle is
// performed.) If the triangulation is Delaunay, then an 

// .SECTION Bugs
// Current implementation (vtk1.1) can break down due to numerical degeneracy. Also is 
// slower than it should be.
