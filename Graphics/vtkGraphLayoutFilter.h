// .NAME vtkGraphLayoutFilter - nice layout of undirected graphs in 3D
// .SECTION Description
// vtkGraphLayoutFilter will reposition a network of nodes, connected by
// lines or polylines, into a more pleasing arrangement. The class 
// implements a simple force-directed placement algorithm 
// (Fruchterman & Reingold "Graph Drawing by Force-directed Placement" 
// Software-Practice and Experience 21(11) 1991).
//
// The input to the filter is a vtkPolyData representing the undirected 
// graphs. A graph is represented by a set of polylines and/or lines. 
// The output is also a vtkPolyData, where the point positions have been 
// modified. To use the filter, specify whether you wish the layout to 
// occur in 2D or 3D; the bounds in which the graph should lie (note that you
// can just use automatic bounds computation); and modify the cool down
// rate (controls the final process of simulated annealing).
