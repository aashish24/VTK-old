// .NAME vtkProjectedTexture - assign texture coordinates for a projected texture
// .SECTION Description
// vtkProjectedTexture assigns texture coordinates to a dataset as if
// the texture was projected from a slide projected located somewhere in the
// scene.  Methods are provided to position the projector and aim it at a 
// location, to set the width of the projector's frustum, and to set the
// range of texture coordinates assigned to the dataset.  
//
// Objects in the scene that appear behind the projector are also assigned
// texture coordinates; the projected image is left-right and top-bottom 
// flipped, much as a lens' focus flips the rays of light that pass through
// it.  A warning is issued if a point in the dataset falls at the focus
// of the projector.
