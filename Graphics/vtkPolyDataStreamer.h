// .NAME vtkPolyDataStreamer - Stream appends input pieces to the output.
// .SECTION Description
// vtkPolyDataStreamer initiates streaming by requesting pieces from its 
// single input it appends these pieces it to the requested output.
// .SECTION Note
// The output may be slightly different if the pipeline does not handle 
// ghost cells properly (i.e. you might see seames between the pieces).
// .SECTION See Also
// vtkAppendFilter

  // Description:
  // Ideally, this filter should determine how to break up the input by
  // a limit on the memory use.  Not all polydata sources and filters 
  // set the EstimatedMemorySize correctly.  The current method is to specify 
  // the concrete number of divisions. Any request wil be further split by this 
  // factor.

  // Description:
