// .NAME vtkPolyDataStreamer - Stream appends input pieces to the output.
// .SECTION Description
// vtkPolyDataStreamer initiates streaming by requesting pieces from its 
// single input it appends these pieces it to the requested output.
// Note that since vtkPolyDataStreamer uses an append filter, all the
// polygons generated have to be kept in memory before rendering. If
// these do not fit in the memory, it is possible to make the vtkPolyDataMapper
// stream. Since the mapper will render each piece separately, all the
// polygons do not have to stored in memory.
// .SECTION Note
// The output may be slightly different if the pipeline does not handle 
// ghost cells properly (i.e. you might see seames between the pieces).
// .SECTION See Also
// vtkAppendFilter
