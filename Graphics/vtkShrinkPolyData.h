// .NAME vtkShrinkPolyData - shrink cells composing PolyData
// .SECTION Description
// vtkShrinkPolyData shrinks cells composing a polygonal dataset (e.g., 
// vertices, lines, polygons, and triangle strips) towards their centroid. 
// The centroid of a cell is computed as the average position of the
// cell points. Shrinking results in disconnecting the cells from
// one another. The output dataset type of this filter is polygonal data.
// .SECTION Caveats
// It is possible to turn cells inside out or cause self intersection
// in special cases.
// .SECTION See Also
// vtkShrinkFilter
