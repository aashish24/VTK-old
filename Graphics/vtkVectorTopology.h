// .NAME vtkVectorTopology - mark points where the vector field vanishes (singularities exist).
// .SECTION Description
// vtkVectorTopology is a filter that marks points where the vector field 
// vanishes. At these points various important flow features are found, 
// including regions of circulation, separation, etc. The region around these
// areas are good places to start streamlines. (The vector field vanishes in 
// cells where the x-y-z vector components each pass through zero.)
//
// The output of this filter is a set of vertices. These vertices mark the 
// vector field singularities. You can use an object like vtkGlyph3D to place
// markers at these points, or use the vertices to initiate streamlines.
//
// The Distance instance variable controls the accuracy of placement of the
// vertices. Smaller values result in greater execution times.
//
// The input to this filter is any dataset type. The position of the 
// vertices is found by sampling the cell in parametric space. Sampling is
// repeated until the Distance criterion is satisfied.
// .SECTION See Also
// vtkGlyph3D vtkStreamLine
