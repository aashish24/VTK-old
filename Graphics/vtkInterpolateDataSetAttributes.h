// .NAME vtkInterpolateDataSetAttributes - interpolate scalars, vectors, etc. and other dataset attributes
// .SECTION Description
// vtkInterpolateDataSetAttributes is a filter that interpolates data set
// attribute values between input data sets. The input to the filter
// must be datasets of the same type, same number of cells, and same 
// number of points. The output of the filter is a data set of the same
// type as the input dataset and whose attribute values have been 
// interpolated at the parametric value specified.
//
// The filter is used by specifying two or more input data sets (total of N),
// and a parametric value t (0 <= t <= N-1). The output will contain
// interpolated data set attributes common to all input data sets. (For
// example, if one input has scalars and vectors, and another has just
// scalars, then only scalars will be interpolated and output.)
