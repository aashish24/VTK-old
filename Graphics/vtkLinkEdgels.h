// .NAME vtkLinkEdgels - links edgels together to form digital curves.
// .SECTION Description
// vtkLinkEdgels links edgels into digital curves which are then stored 
// as polylines. The algorithm works one pixel at a time only looking at
// its immediate neighbors. There is a GradientThreshold that can be set 
// that eliminates any pixels with a smaller gradient value. This can
// be used as the lower threshold of a two value edgel thresholding. 
//
// For the remaining edgels, links are first tried for the four
// connected neighbors.  A successful neighbor will satisfy three
// tests. First both edgels must be above the gradient
// threshold. Second, the difference between the orientation between
// the two edgels (Alpha) and each edgels orientation (Phi) must be
// less than LinkThreshold. Third, the difference between the two
// edgels Phi values must be less than PhiThreshold.
// The most successful link is selected. The measure is simply the 
// sum of the three angle differences (actually stored as the sum of
// the cosines). If none of the four connect neighbors succeeds, then
// the eight connect neighbors are examined using the same method.
//  
// This filter requires gradient information so you will need to use
// a vtkImageGradient at some point prior to this filter.  Typically
// a vtkNonMaximumSuppression filter is also used. vtkThresholdEdgels
// can be used to complete the two value edgel thresholding as used
// in a Canny edge detector. The vtkSubpixelPositionEdgels filter 
// can also be used after this filter to adjust the edgel locations.
