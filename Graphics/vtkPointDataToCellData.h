// .NAME vtkPointDataToCellData - map point data to cell data
// .SECTION Description
// vtkPointDataToCellData is a filter that transforms point data (i.e., data
// specified per point) into cell data (i.e., data specified per cell).
// The method of transformation is based on averaging the data
// values of all points defining a particular cell. Optionally, the input point
// data can be passed through to the output as well.

// .SECTION Caveats
// This filter is an abstract filter, that is, the output is an abstract type
// (i.e., vtkDataSet). Use the convenience methods (e.g.,
// vtkGetPolyDataOutput(), GetStructuredPointsOutput(), etc.) to get the type
// of output you want.

// .SECTION See Also
// vtkDataSetToDataSetFilter vtkPointData vtkCellData vtkCellDataToPointData
