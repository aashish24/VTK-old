// .NAME vtkDicer - abstract superclass to divide dataset into pieces
// .SECTION Description
// Subclasses of vtkDicer divides the input dataset into separate
// pieces.  These pieces can then be operated on by other filters
// (e.g., vtkThreshold). One application is to break very large
// polygonal models into pieces and performing viewing and occlusion
// culling on the pieces. Multiple pieces can also be streamed through
// the visualization pipeline.
//
// To use this filter, you must specify the execution mode of the
// filter; i.e., set the way that the piece size is controlled (do
// this by setting the DiceMode ivar). The filter does not change the
// geometry or topology of the input dataset, rather it generates
// integer numbers that indicate which piece a particular point
// belongs to (i.e., it modifies the point and cell attribute
// data). The integer number can be placed into the output scalar
// data, or the output field data.

// .SECTION Caveats
// The number of pieces generated may be less that the specified number
// of pieces. 

// .SECTION See Also
// vtkOBBDicer vtkConnectedDicer vtkSpatialDicer
