// .NAME vtkDicer - divide dataset into spatially aggregated pieces
// .SECTION Description
// vtkDicer separates the cells of a dataset into spatially aggregated 
// pieces. These pieces can then be operated on by other filters (e.g.,
// vtkThreshold). One application is to break very large polygonal models
// into pieces and performing viewing and occlusion culling on the pieces.
//
// To use this filter, you must specify the number of points per piece. The
// filter attempts to create groups of points (containing the number of cells
// specified). The groups are created to minimize the size of the bounding 
// box of the group. The filter indicates which group the points belong in
// by creating a scalar value corresponding to group number. Use the method
// GetNumberOfPieces() to determine how many pieces were found.

// .SECTION Caveats
// The number of cells per group will not always be less than the requested
// value. The groups are not guaranteed to generate the minimal bounding 
// boxes.

// .SECTION See Also
// vtkThreshold
