// .NAME vtkTextureMapToCylinder - generate texture coordinates by mapping points to cylinder
// .SECTION Description
// vtkTextureMapToCylinder is a filter that generates 2D texture coordinates
// by mapping input dataset points onto a cylinder. The cylinder can either be
// user specified or generated automatically. (The cylinder is generated 
// automatically by computing the axis of the cylinder.)  Note that the
// generated texture coordinates for the s-coordinate ranges from (0-1) 
// (corresponding to angle of 0->360 around axis), while the mapping of 
// the t-coordinate is controlled by the projection of points along the axis.
//
// To specify a cylinder manually, you must provide two points that
// define the axis of the cylinder. The length of the axis will affect the
// t-coordinates.
// 
// A special ivar controls how the s-coordinate is generated. If PreventSeam
// is set to true, the s-texture varies from 0->1 and then 1->0 (corresponding
// to angles of 0->180 and 180->360).

// .Section Caveats
// Since the resulting texture s-coordinate will lie between (0,1), and the 
// origin of the texture coordinates is not user-controllable, you may want to se 
// the class vtkTransformTexture to linearly scale and shift the origin of the texture
// coordinates.
