// .NAME vtkCylinderSource - generate a cylinder centered at origin
// .SECTION Description
// vtkCylinderSource creates a polygonal cylinder centered at Center;
// The axis of the cylinder is aligned along the global y-axis.
// The height and radius of the cylinder can be specified, as well as the
// number of sides. It is also possible to control whether the cylinder is
// open-ended or capped.
