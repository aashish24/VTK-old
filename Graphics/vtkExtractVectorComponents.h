// .NAME vtkExtractVectorComponents - extract components of vector as separate scalars
// .SECTION Description
// vtkExtractVectorComponents is a filter that extracts vector components as
// separate scalars. This is accomplished by creating three different outputs.
// Each output is the same as the input, except that the scalar values will be
// one of the three components of the vector. These can be found in the
// VxComponent, VyComponent, and VzComponent.

// .SECTION Caveats
// This filter is unusual in that it creates multiple outputs. As a result,
// it cannot take advantage of the convenience classes (e.g., 
// vtkPolyDataToPolyDataFilter) for deriving concrete filters. Instead, it overloads 
// the Update() method of its superclasses and provides methods for retrieving
// the output.
//
// If you use the GetOutput() method, you will be retrieving the x vector component.
