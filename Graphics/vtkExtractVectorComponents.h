// .NAME vtkExtractVectorComponents - extract components of vector as separate scalars
// .SECTION Description
// vtkExtractVectorComponents is a filter that extracts vector components as
// separate scalars. This is accomplished by creating three different outputs.
// Each output is the same as the input, except that the scalar values will be
// one of the three components of the vector. These can be found in the
// VxComponent, VyComponent, and VzComponent.
// Alternatively, if the ExtractToFieldData flag is set, the filter will
// put all the components in the field data. The first component will be
// the scalar and the others will be non-attribute arrays.

// .SECTION Caveats
// This filter is unusual in that it creates multiple outputs. 
// If you use the GetOutput() method, you will be retrieving the x vector 
// component.

  // Get the output dataset representing velocity x-component. If output is

  // GetOutput() method with an index of 0.)
  vtkDataSet *GetVxComponent();

  // Description:
  // Get the output dataset representing velocity y-component. If output is
  // NULL then input hasn't been set, which is necessary for abstract
  // objects. (Note: this method returns the same information as the
  // GetOutput() method with an index of 1.)
  // Note that if ExtractToFieldData is true, this output will be empty.

  // Description:

  // Description:
  // Get the output dataset containing the indicated component. The component
