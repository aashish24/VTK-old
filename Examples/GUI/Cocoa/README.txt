This is an xcode 2.2 sample project that shows how to combine VTK with Cocoa in a Window with other UI elements. In order to use this project the user will have to reset where to find the VTK libraries and Header files as they were not in a standard location on my machine.
   This project is a Cocoa-Application type project. The project simply shows how to subclass vtkCocoaGLView, over ride some features and hook up UI elements to methods in the controller class.
   There should be another project created that is a Cocoa-Document based project. This would show creating multiple windows and how to manage those windows.
