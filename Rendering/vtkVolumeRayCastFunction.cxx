// Description:
// Grab everything we need for rendering now. This procedure will be called
// during the initialization phase of ray casting. It is called once per 
// image. All Gets are done here for both performance and multithreading
// reentrant requirements reasons. At the end, the SpecificFunctionInitialize
// is called to give the subclass a chance to do its thing.
