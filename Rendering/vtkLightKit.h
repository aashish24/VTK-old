// .NAME vtkLightKit - a simple but quality lighting kit
// .SECTION Description
// vtkLightKit is designed to make general purpose lighting of vtk
// scenes simple, flexible, and attractive (or at least not horribly
// ugly without significant effort).  Use a LightKit when you want
// more control over your lighting than you can get with the default
// vtk light, which is a headlight located at the camera. (Headlights
// are very simple to use, but they don't show the shape of objects very 
// well, don't give a good sense of "up" and "down", and don't evenly
// light the object.)
//
// A LightKit consists of three lights, a key light, a fill light, and
// a headlight.  The main light is the key light.  It is usually
// positioned so that it appears like an overhead light (like the sun,
// or a ceiling light).  It is generally positioned to shine down on the
// scene from about a 45 degree angle vertically and at least a little
// offset side to side.  The key light usually at least about twice as 
// bright as the total of all other lights in the scene to provide good
// modeling of object features.
// 
// The other two lights in the kit, the fill light and headlight, are
// weaker sources that provide extra illumination to fill in the spots
// that the key light misses.  The fill light is usually positioned
// across from or opposite from the key light (though still on the
// same side of the object as the camera) in order to simulate diffuse
// reflections from other objects in the scene.  The headlight, always
// located at the position of the camera, reduces the contrast between
// areas lit by the key and fill light. To enforce the relationship
// between the three lights, the intensity of the fill and headlights
// are set as a ratio to the key light brightness.  Thus, the brightness
// of all the lights in the scene can be changed by changing the key light 
// intensity.
//
// For simplicity, the position of lights in the LightKit can only be
// specified using angles: the elevation (latitude) and azimuth
// (longitude) of each light with respect to the camera.  All lights
// are directional lights (infinitely far away with no falloff).
//
// vtkLightKit limits the colors that can be assigned to any light to
// those of incandescent sources such as light bulbs and sunlight.  It
// defines a special color spectrum called "warmth" from which light
// colors can be chosen, where 0 is cold blue, 0.5 is neutral white,
// and 1 is deep sunset red.  Colors close to 0.5 are "cool whites" and
// "warm whites," respectively. 
//
// Since colors far from white on the warmth scale appear less bright,
// key-to-fill and key-to-headlight ratios are skewed by 
// key, fill, and headlight colors.  If the flag MaintainLuminance
// is set, vtkLightKit will attempt to compensate for these perceptual
// differences by increasing the brightness of more saturated colors.
//
// A LightKit is not explicitly part of the vtk pipeline.  Rather, it
// is a composite object that controls the behavior of lights using a
// unified user interface.  Every time a parameter of vtkLightKit is
// adjusted, the properties of its lights are modified.
//
// .SECTION Credits
// vtkLightKit was originally written and contributed to vtk by
// Michael Halle (mhalle@bwh.harvard.edu) at the Surgical Planning
// Lab, Brigham and Women's Hospital.

  // light, while still maintaining constrast.  This type of lighting
  // may correspond to indirect illumination from the key light, bounced
  // off a wall, floor, or other object.  The fill light should never
  // be brighter than the key light:  a good range for the key-to-fill
  // ratio is between 3 and 10.

  // Set/Get the key-to-headlight ratio.  Similar to the key-to-fill
  // ratio, this ratio controls how bright the headlight light is
  // compared to the key light: larger values correspond to a dimmer
  // headlight light.  The headlight is special kind of fill light,
  // lighting only the parts of the object that the camera can see.
  // As such, a headlight tends to reduce the contrast of a scene.  It
  // can be used to fill in "shadows" of the object missed by the key
  // and fill lights.  The headlight should always be significantly
  // dimmer than the key light:  ratios of 3 to 15 are typical.

  // blue sky), 1 is "warm" (the red of a very red sunset, or the
  // embers of a campfire), and 0.5 is a neutral white.  The warmth
  // scale is non-linear. Warmth values close to 0.5 are subtly
  // "warmer" or "cooler," much like a warmer tungsten incandescent
  // bulb, a cooler halogen, or daylight (cooler still).  Moving
  // further away from 0.5, colors become more quickly varying towards
  // blues and reds.  With regards to aesthetics, extremes of warmth
