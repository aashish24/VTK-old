// .NAME vtkXRenderWindowInteractor - an X event driven interface for a RenderWindow
// .SECTION Description
// vtkXRenderWindowInteractor is a convenience object that provides event
// bindings to common graphics functions. For example, camera and actor
// functions such as zoom-in/zoom-out, azimuth, roll, and pan. IT is one of
// the window system specific subclasses of vtkRenderWindowInteractor. Please
// see vtkRenderWindowInteractor documentation for event bindings.

// .SECTION see also
// vtkRenderWindowInteractor vtkXRenderWindow

  // Description:
  // Initializes the event handlers without an XtAppContext.  This is
  // good for when you don't have a user interface, but you still
  // want to have mouse interaction.
  virtual void Initialize();

  // Description: 
  // Initializes the event handlers using an XtAppContext that you have
  // provided.  This assumes that you want to own the event loop.
  virtual void Initialize(XtAppContext app);

  // Description:
  // This will start up the X event loop and never return. If you
  // call this method it will loop processing X events until the
  // application is exited.
  virtual void Start();
  virtual void UpdateSize(int,int);

  // Description:
  // Provide implementaitons of the methods defined in
  // vtkRenderWindowInteractor. Generally the application developer should
  // not invoke these methods directly.

  // Description:
  // Specify the Xt widget to use for interaction. This method is
  // one of a couple steps that are required for setting up a
  // vtkRenderWindowInteractor as a widget inside of another user 
  // interface. You do not need to use this method if the render window
  // will be a stand-alone window. This is only used when you want the
  // render window to be a subwindow within a larger user interface.
  // In that case, you must tell the render window what X display id
  // to use, and then ask the render window what depth, visual and 
  // colormap it wants. Then, you must create an Xt TopLevelShell with
  // those settings. Then you can create the rest of your user interface
  // as a child of the TopLevelShell you created. Eventually, you will 
  // create a drawing area or some other widget to serve as the rendering
  // window. You must use the SetWidget method to tell this Interactor
  // about that widget. It's X and it's not terribly easy, but it looks cool.
  virtual void SetWidget(Widget);

  // Finish setting up a new window after the WindowRemap.
