// .NAME vtkRenderWindowInteractor - provide event driven interface to rendering window

// .SECTION Description
// vtkRenderWindowInteractor is a convenience object that provides event
// bindings to common graphics functions. For example, camera
// zoom-in/zoom-out, pan, rotate, resetting; picking of actors, points,
// or cells; switching in/out of stereo mode; property changes such as
// wireframe and surface; and a toggle to force the light to be placed at
// camera viewpoint (pointing in view direction).
// 
// Specific devices have different camera bindings. The bindings are on both
// mouse events as well as keyboard presses. See vtkXRenderWindowInteractor  
// and vtkWin32RenderWindowInteractor for specific information.
