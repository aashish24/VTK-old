// .NAME vtkLight - a virtual light for 3D rendering
// .SECTION Description
// vtkLight is a virtual light for 3D rendering. It provides methods to locate
// and point the light, turn it on and off, and set its brightness and color.
// In addition to the basic infinite distance point light source attributes,
// you also can specify the light attenuation values and cone angle.
// These attributes are only used if the light is a positional light.
// The default is a directional light (e.g. infinite point light source).

// .SECTION see also
// vtkLightDevice
