// .NAME vtkLight - a virtual light for 3D rendering
// .SECTION Description
// vtkLight is a virtual light for 3D rendering. It provides methods to locate
// and point the light, turn it on and off, and set its brightness and color.
// In addition to the basic infinite distance point light source attributes,
// you also can specify the light attenuation values and cone angle.
// These attributes are only used if the light is a positional light.
// The default is a directional light (e.g. infinite point light source).
//
// Lights have a type that describes how the light should move with respect
// to the camera.  A Headlight is always located at the current camera position
// and shines on the camera's focal point.  A CameraLight also moves with
// the camera, but may not be coincident to it.  CameraLights are defined
// in a normalized coordinate space where the camera is located at (0, 0, 1),
// the camera is looking at (0, 0, 0), and up is (0, 1, 0).  Finally, a 
// SceneLight is part of the scene itself and does not move with the camera.
// (Renderers are responsible for moving the light based on its type.)
//
// Lights have a transformation matrix that describes the space in which
// they are positioned.  A light's world space position and focal point
// are defined by their local position and focal point, transformed by
// their transformation matrix (if it exists).
