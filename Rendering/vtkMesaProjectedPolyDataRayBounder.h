// .NAME vtkMesaProjectedPolyDataRayBounder - Open GL ray bounder
//
// .SECTION Description
// vtkMesaProjectedPolyDataRayBounder is the specific Open GL 
// implementation of the superclass vtkProjectedPolyDataRayBounder.
// It is responsible for building its own internal structure from the 
// generic vtkPolyData structure (it builds a display list) and for rendering
// its internal structure and creating near and far depth buffers.
// It has no public methods, and should not be created directly - the
// New();
// create the correct subclass given the current VTK_RENDERER

// .SECTION see also
// vtkProjectedPolyDataRayBounder
