// .NAME vtkAbstractPicker - define API for picking subclasses
// .SECTION Description
// vtkAbstractPicker is an abstract superclass that defines a minimal API
// for its concrete subclasses. The minimum functionality of a picker is
// to return the x-y-z global coordinate position of a pick (the pick
// itself is defined in display coordinates).
//
// The API to this class is to invoke the Pick() method with a selection
// point (in display coordinates - pixels) and a renderer. Then get the
// resulting pick position in global coordinates with the GetPickPosition()
// method.
//
// vtkPicker has hooks for methods to call during the picking process.  These
// methods are StartPickMethod(), PickMethod(), and EndPickMethod() which are
// invoked prior to picking, when something is picked, and after all picking
// candidates have been tested. Note that during the pick process the
// PickMethod() of vtkProp (and its subclasses such as vtkActor) is called
// prior to the pick method of vtkPicker.

// .SECTION Caveats
// vtkAbstractPicker and its subclasses will not pick props that are 
// "unpickable" (see vtkProp) or are fully transparent (if transparency
// is a property of the vtkProp).
//
// There are two classes of pickers: those that pick using geometric methods
// (typically a ray cast); and those that use rendering hardware. Geometric
// methods return more information but are slower. Hardware methods are much
// faster and return minimal information. Examples of geometric pickers
// include vtkPicker, vtkCellPicker, and vtkPointPicker. Examples of hardware
// pickers include vtkWorldPointPicker and vtkPropPicker.

// .SECTION See Also
// vtkPropPicker uses hardware acceleration to pick an instance of vtkProp.
// (This means that 2D and 3D props can be picked, and it's relatively fast.)
// If you need to pick cells or points, you might wish to use vtkCellPicker
// or vtkPointPicker. vtkWorldPointPicker is the fastest picker, returning
// an x-y-z coordinate value using the hardware z-buffer. vtkPicker can be
// used to pick the bounding box of 3D props.
