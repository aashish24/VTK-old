// .NAME vtkDataSetMapper - map vtkDataSet and derived classes to graphics primitives
// .SECTION Description
// vtkDataSetMapper is a mapper to map data sets (i.e., vtkDataSet and 
// all derived classes) to graphics primitives. The mapping procedure
// is as follows: all 0D, 1D, and 2D cells are converted into points,
// lines, and polygons/triangle strips and then mapped to the graphics 
// system. The 2D faces of 3D cells are mapped only if they are used by 
// only one cell, i.e., on the boundary of the data set.
