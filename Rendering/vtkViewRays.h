// .NAME vtkViewRays - provides view ray information for efficiently casting rays
// .SECTION Description
// The vtkViewRays class calculates and stores the relevant information 
// necessary to efficiently render perspective or parallel viewing rays. 
// View rays are typically used by a ray caster where a view ray is
// cast per pixel in the requested image. 
//
// The number of view rays requested in both X and Y is specified by
// the SetSize() method. The camera model used to create the view ray 
// information is specified by the SetRenderer() method. Both the SetSize()
// and SetRenderer() method must be called before viewing ray information 
// can be requested. vtkViewRays will recompute view ray information should
// the critical information in the camera, the renderer or number of rays 
// change.
//
// vtkViewRays contains view ray information in view coordinates for either 
// parallel or perspective viewing transformations. This reduces the
// computational burden on a ray caster since the computation of perspective,
// normalized viewing ray vectors is pre-computed once rather than during each
// rendering.
// 
// When the camera viewing transform is perspective the start of each 
// viewing vector (eye point) is fixed, but the direction of each ray varies. 
// Therefore, vtkViewRays contains a 2D array of 3D unit vectors each 
// representing the direction of a view ray with respect to the viewing 
// coordinate system. A pointer to this 2D array of vectors is obtained by 
// calling the GetPerspectiveViewRays() method.
//
// When the camera viewing transform is parallel the start of each viewing 
// vector varies across the viewing plane but the direction remains constant. 
// Since the starting point of each view ray can be captured by regularly 
// sampling the parallel viewing plane, a 2D array of starting view ray 
// positions is NOT used. Instead, the first view ray position (bottom left
// corner of view) is returned by the GetParallelStartPosition() method and
// the X and Y distance increments to the next view ray starting position 
// are returned by the GetParallelIncrements() method.
