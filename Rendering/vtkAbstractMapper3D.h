// .NAME vtkAbstractMapper3D - abstract class specifies interface to map 3D data
// .SECTION Description
// vtkAbstractMapper3D is an abstract class to specify interface between 3D
// data and graphics primitives or software rendering techniques. Subclasses
// of vtkAbstractMapper3D can be used for rendering geometry or rendering
// volumetric data.
//
// This class also defines an API to support hardware clipping planes (at most
// six planes can be defined). It also provides geometric data about the input
// data it maps, such as the bounding box and center.
