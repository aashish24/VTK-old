// .NAME vlCellPicker - select a cell by shooting a ray into graphics window
// .SECTION Description
// vlCellPicker is used to select a cell by shooting a ray into graphics
// window and intersecting with actor's defining geometry - specifically 
// its cells. Beside returning coordinates, actor and mapper, vlCellPicker
// returns the id of the closest cell within the tolerance along the pick
// ray, and the dataset that was picked.
// .SECTION See Also
// For quick picking, see vlPicker. To pick points, see vlPointPicker.
