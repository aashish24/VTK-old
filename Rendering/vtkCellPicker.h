// .NAME vtkCellPicker - select a cell by shooting a ray into graphics window
// .SECTION Description
// vtkCellPicker is used to select a cell by shooting a ray into graphics
// window and intersecting with actor's defining geometry - specifically 
// its cells. Beside returning coordinates, actor and mapper, vtkCellPicker
// returns the id of the closest cell within the tolerance along the pick
// ray, and the dataset that was picked.
// .SECTION See Also
// For quick picking, see vtkPicker. To pick points, see vtkPointPicker.
