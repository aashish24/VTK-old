// .NAME vtkRendererSource - take a renderer into the pipeline
// .SECTION Description
// vtkRendererSource is a source object that gets its input from a 
// renderer and converts it to structured points. This can then be 
// used in a visualization pipeline. You must explicitly send a 
// Modify() to this object to get it to reload its data from the
// renderer.

// .SECTION see also
// vtkRenderer vtkStructuredPoints
