// .NAME vtkRayBounder - An abstract class for bounding rays
// .SECTION Description
// vtkRayBounder is an abstract class for bounding view rays during
// ray casting. Each concrete subclass must have a GetRayBounds 
// method which, given a renderer, produces a floating point array
// that is w*h*2 (w = width of viewport, h = height of viewport).
// For each pixel, this array contains the near and far clipping
// values for the corresponding ray. A value of -1 means no clipping
// should be performed on that ray.

// .SECTION see also

  // Description:
  // Get the ray bounds - a floating point array with two
  // values for every pixel in the viewport. These values
  // indicate near and far clipping distances, or -1 for
  // no clipping.
