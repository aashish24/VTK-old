// .NAME vtkFiniteDifferenceGradientEstimator - Use finite differences to estimate gradient.
//
// .SECTION Description
//  vtkFiniteDifferenceGradientEstimator is a concrete subclass of 
//  vtkEncodedGradientEstimator that uses a central differences technique to
//  estimate the gradient. The gradient at some sample location (x,y,z)
//  would be estimated by:
//      
//       nx = (f(x-dx,y,z) - f(x+dx,y,z)) / 2*dx;
//       ny = (f(x,y-dy,z) - f(x,y+dy,z)) / 2*dy;
//       nz = (f(x,y,z-dz) - f(x,y,z+dz)) / 2*dz;
//
//  This value is normalized to determine a unit direction vector and a
//  magnitude. The normal is computed in voxel space, and 
//  dx = dy = dz = SampleSpacingInVoxels. A scaling factor is applied to
//  convert this normal from voxel space to world coordinates.
//
