// .NAME vtkPropPicker - pick an actor/prop using graphics hardware
// .SECTION Description
// vtkPropPicker is used to pick an actor/prop given a selection
// point (in display coordinates) and a renderer. This class uses
// graphics hardware/rendering system to pick rapidly (as compared
// to using ray casting as does vtkCellPicker and vtkPointPicker).
// This class determines the actor/prop and pick position in world
// coordinates; point and cell ids are not determined.

// .SECTION See Also 
// vtkPicker vtkWorldPointPicker vtkCellPicker vtkPointPicker

  // Description:
  // Perform the pick and set the PickedProp ivar. If something is picked, a
  // 1 is returned, otherwise 0 is returned.  Use the GetProp() method
  // to get the instance of vtkProp that was picked.  Props are picked from
  // the renderers list of pickable Props.
