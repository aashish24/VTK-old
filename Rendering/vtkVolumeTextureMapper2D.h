// .NAME vtkVolumeTextureMapper2D - Abstract class for a volume mapper

// .SECTION Description
// vtkVolumeTextureMapper2D renders a volume using 2D texture mapping.


// .SECTION see also
// vtkVolumeMapper

  // Description:
  // Target size in pixels of each size of the texture for downloading. Default is
  // 512x512 - so a 512x512 texture will be tiled with as many slices of the volume
  // as possible, then all the quads will be rendered. This can be set to optimize
  // for a particular architecture. This must be set with numbers that are a power
  // of two.

  // Description:
  // This is the maximum number of planes that will be created for texture mapping
  // the volume. If the volume has more voxels than this along the viewing direction,
  // then planes of the volume will be skipped to ensure that this maximum is not
  // violated. A skip factor is used, and is incremented until the maximum condition
  // is satisfied.
