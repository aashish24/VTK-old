// .NAME vtkActor - represents an object (geometry & properties) in a rendered scene 
// .SECTION Description
// vtkActor is used to represent an entity in a rendering scene.  It
// inherits functions related to the actors position, and orientation
// from vtkProp. The actor also has scaling and maintains a reference to the
// defining geometry (i.e., the mapper), rendering properties, and
// possibly a texture map.
// vtkActor combines these instance variables into one 4x4
// transformation matrix as follows: [x y z 1] = [x y z 1]
// Translate(-origin) Scale(scale) Rot(y) Rot(x) Rot (z) Trans(origin)
// Trans(position)

// vtkAssembly vtkFollower vtkLODActor

  // Description: 
  // Set/Get the property object that controls this
  // actors surface properties.  This should be an instance of a
  // vtkProperty object.  Every actor must have a property associated
  // with it.  If one isn't specified, then one will be generated
  // automatically. Multiple actors can share one property object.

  // texture maps.  This will be a vtkTexture object. An actor does
  // not need to have an associated texture map and multiple actors
  // can share one texture.

  // Description:
  // This is the method that is used to connect an actor to the end of a

  // of vtkMapper. Typically vtkPolyDataMapper and vtkDataSetMapper will
  // be used.

  // Description:
  // In addition to the instance variables such as position and orientation,
  // you can specify your own 4x4 transformation matrix that will
  // get concatenated with the actor's 4x4 matrix as determined
  // by the other instance variables. If the other instance variables such
  // as position and orientation are left with  their default values then 
  // they will result in the identity matrix. And the resulting matrix
  // will be the user defined matrix.

  // Description:
  // Subclasses of vtkActor can be composed of one or more parts. A part is an
  // actor or subclass of actor (e.g., vtkAssembly). The methods 
  // InitPartTraversal() and GetNextPart() allow you to get at the parts
  // that compose the actor. To use these methods - first invoke 
  // InitPartTraversal() followed by repeated calls to GetNextPart(). 
  // GetNextPart() returns a NULL pointer when the list is exhausted. (These
  // methods differ from the vtkAssembly::GetParts() method, which returns 
  // a list of the parts that are first level children of the assembly.)
