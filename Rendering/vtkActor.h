// .NAME vtkActor - represents an object (geometry & properties) in a rendered scene 
// .SECTION Description
// vtkActor is used to represent an entity in a rendering scene.  It
// inherits functions related to the actors position, and orientation
// from vtkProp. The actor also has scaling and maintains a reference to the
// defining geometry (i.e., the mapper), rendering properties, and
// possibly a texture map.
// vtkActor combines these instance variables into one 4x4
// transformation matrix as follows: [x y z 1] = [x y z 1]
// Translate(-origin) Scale(scale) Rot(y) Rot(x) Rot (z) Trans(origin)
// Trans(position)

  // Description:
  // Creates an actor with the following defaults: origin(0,0,0)
  // position=(0,0,0) scale=(1,1,1) visibility=1 pickable=1 dragable=1
  // orientation=(0,0,0). No user defined matrix and no texture map.

  // For some exporters and other other operations we must be
  // able to collect all the actors or volumes. These methods
  // are used in that process.

  // Description:
  // Support the standard render methods.
  virtual int RenderOpaqueGeometry(vtkViewport *viewport);
  virtual int RenderTranslucentGeometry(vtkViewport *viewport);

  // Description:
  // This causes the actor to be rendered. It in turn will render the actor's
  // property, texture map and then mapper. If a property hasn't been
  // assigned, then the actor will create one automatically. Note that a side
  // effect of this method is that the
  virtual void Render(vtkRenderer *, vtkMapper *) {};

  // Description:
  // Shallow copy of an actor.
  vtkActor &operator=(const vtkActor& actor);

  // Description:
  // Release any graphics resources that are being consumed by this actor.
  // The parameter window could be used to determine which graphic
  // resources to release.
  void ReleaseGraphicsResources(vtkWindow *);

  // Description: 
  // Set/Get the property object that controls this actors surface
  // properties.  This should be an instance of a vtkProperty object.  Every
  // actor must have a property associated with it.  If one isn't specified,
  // then one will be generated automatically. Multiple actors can share one
  // property object.
  void SetProperty(vtkProperty *lut);

  // Description: 
  // Set/Get the property object that controls this actors backface surface
  // properties.  This should be an instance of a vtkProperty object. If one
  // isn't specified, then the front face properties will be used.  Multiple
  // actors can share one property object.
  void SetBackfaceProperty(vtkProperty *lut);
  vtkProperty *GetBackfaceProperty();

  // Description: 
  // Set/Get the texture object to control rendering texture maps.  This will
  // be a vtkTexture object. An actor does not need to have an associated
  // texture map and multiple actors can share one texture.
  vtkSetObjectMacro(Texture,vtkTexture);
  vtkGetObjectMacro(Texture,vtkTexture);

  // Description:
  // This is the method that is used to connect an actor to the end of a
  // visualization pipeline, i.e. the mapper. This should be a subclass
  // of vtkMapper. Typically vtkPolyDataMapper and vtkDataSetMapper will
  // be used.

  // Returns the Mapper that this actor is getting its data from.

  // Set/Get the scale of the actor. Scaling in performed independently on the
  // X, Y and Z axis. A scale of zero is illegal and will be replaced with one.

  // Description:
  // Get the matrix from the position, origin, scale and orientation This
  // matrix is cached, so multiple GetMatrix() calls will be efficient.

  // Get the bounds for this Actor as (Xmin,Xmax,Ymin,Ymax,Zmin,Zmax). (The
  // method GetBounds(float bounds[6]) is available from the superclass.)
  float *GetBounds();

  // Description:
  // Subclasses of vtkActor can be composed of one or more parts. A part is an
  // actor or subclass of actor (e.g., vtkAssembly). The methods 
  // InitPartTraversal() and GetNextPart() allow you to get at the parts
  // that compose the actor. To use these methods - first invoke 
  // InitPartTraversal() followed by repeated calls to GetNextPart(). 
  // GetNextPart() returns a NULL pointer when the list is exhausted. (These
  // methods differ from the vtkAssembly::GetParts() method, which returns 
  // a list of the parts that are first level children of the assembly.)

  // Used to construct assembly paths and perform part traversal.
  virtual void BuildPaths(vtkAssemblyPaths *paths, vtkActorCollection *path);

  // Description:
  // Apply the current properties to all parts that compose this actor.
  // This method is overloaded in vtkAssembly to apply the assemblies'
  // properties to all its parts in a recursive manner. Typically the
  // use of this method is to set the desired properties in the assembly,
  // and then push the properties down to the assemblies parts with
  // ApplyProperties().
  virtual void ApplyProperties() {return;};

  // Description:
  // Update visualization pipeline and any other parts of actor that are
  // necessary.
  virtual void Update();

  // Description:
  // Get the actors mtime plus consider its properties, texture and
  // usermatrix if set.

  // Description:
  // For legacy compatibility. Do not use.

  void SetBackfaceProperty(vtkProperty& lut) 
    {this->SetBackfaceProperty(&lut);};
  void GetMatrix(vtkMatrix4x4 &m) {this->GetMatrix(&m);}

  // Description:
  // Return the mtime of anything that would cause the rendered image to 
  // appear differently. Usually this involves checking the mtime of the 
  // prop plus anything else it depends on such as properties, textures
  // etc.
