// .NAME vtkActor - represents an object (geometry & properties) in a rendered scene 
// .SECTION Description
// 
// vtkActor is used to represent an entity in a rendering scene.  It inherits
// functions related to the actors position, and orientation from
// vtkProp. The actor also has scaling and maintains a reference to the
// defining geometry (i.e., the mapper), rendering properties, and possibly a
// texture map. vtkActor combines these instance variables into one 4x4
// transformation matrix as follows: [x y z 1] = [x y z 1] Translate(-origin)
// Scale(scale) Rot(y) Rot(x) Rot (z) Trans(origin) Trans(position)

// .SECTION See Also

  // Creates an actor with the following defaults: origin(0,0,0)

  // orientation=(0,0,0). No user defined matrix and no texture map.

  // Support the standard render methods.

  // Description:
  // This causes the actor to be rendered. It in turn will render the actor's
  // property, texture map and then mapper. If a property hasn't been
  // assigned, then the actor will create one automatically. Note that a side
  // effect of this method is that the pipeline will be updated.

  // The parameter window could be used to determine which graphic
  // resources to release.

  // Description: 
  // Set/Get the property object that controls this actors surface
  // properties.  This should be an instance of a vtkProperty object.  Every
  // actor must have a property associated with it.  If one isn't specified,
  // then one will be generated automatically. Multiple actors can share one
  // property object.

  // isn't specified, then the front face properties will be used.  Multiple
  // actors can share one property object.

  // texture map and multiple actors can share one texture.

  // Description:
  // Apply the current properties to all parts that compose this actor.
  // This method is overloaded in vtkAssembly to apply the assemblies'
  // properties to all its parts in a recursive manner. Typically the
  // use of this method is to set the desired properties in the assembly,
  // and then push the properties down to the assemblies parts with
  // ApplyProperties().

  // usermatrix if set.

  // appear differently. Usually this involves checking the mtime of the 
  // prop plus anything else it depends on such as properties, textures
  // etc.
  virtual unsigned long GetRedrawMTime();

  // Description:
  // The following methods are for compatibility. The methods will be deprecated
  // in the near future. Use vtkProp::GetNextPath() (and related functionality)

  // assembly).
