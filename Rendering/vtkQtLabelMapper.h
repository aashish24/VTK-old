// .NAME vtkQtLabelMapper - draw text labels at 2D dataset points
// .SECTION Description
// vtkQtLabelMapper is a mapper that renders text at dataset
// points such that the labels do not overlap.
// Various items can be labeled including point ids, scalars,
// vectors, normals, texture coordinates, tensors, and field data components.
// This mapper assumes that the points are located on the x-y plane
// and that the camera remains perpendicular to that plane with a y-up
// axis (this can be constrained using vtkImageInteractor).
// On the first render, the mapper computes the visiblility of all labels
// at all scales, and queries this information on successive renders.
// This causes the first render to be much slower. The visibility algorithm
// is a greedy approach based on the point id, so the label for a point
// will be drawn unless the label for a point with lower id overlaps it.

// .SECTION Caveats
// Use this filter in combination with vtkSelectVisiblePoints if you want
// to label only points that are visible. If you want to label cells rather
// than points, use the filter vtkCellCenters to generate points at the
// center of the cells. Also, you can use the class vtkIdFilter to
// generate ids as scalars or field data, which can then be labeled.
