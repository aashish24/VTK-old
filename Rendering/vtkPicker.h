// .NAME vtkPicker - superclass for 3D geometric pickers (uses ray cast)
// .SECTION Description
// vtkPicker is used to select instances of vtkProp3D by shooting a ray 
// into a graphics window and intersecting with the actor's bounding box. 
// The ray is defined from a point defined in window (or pixel) coordinates, 
// and a point located from the camera's position.
//
// vtkPicker may return more than one vtkProp3D, since more than one bounding 
// box may be intersected. vtkPicker returns the list of props that were hit, 
// the pick coordinates in world and untransformed mapper space, and the 
// prop (vtkProp3D) and mapper that are "closest" to the camera. The closest 
// prop is the one whose center point (i.e., center of bounding box) 
// projected on the ray is closest to the camera.

// .SECTION See Also
// vtkPicker is used for quick geometric picking. If you desire to pick
// points or cells, use the subclass vtkPointPicker or vtkCellPicker,
// respectively.  Or you may use hardware picking to pick any type of vtkProp
// - see vtkPropPicker or vtkWorldPointPicker.
