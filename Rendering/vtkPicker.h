// .NAME vlPicker - select an actor by shooting a ray into graphics window
// .SECTION Description
// vlPicker is used to select actors by shooting a ray into graphics window
// and intersecting with actor's bounding box. The ray is defined from a 
// point defined in window (or pixel) coordinates, and a point located from 
// the camera's position.
//    vlPicker may return more than one actor, since more than one bounding 
// box may be intersected. VlPicker returns the list of actors that were hit, 
// the pick coordinates in world and untransformed mapper space, and the 
// actor and mapper that are "closest" to the camera. The closest actor is 
// the one whose center point (i.e., center of bounding box) projected on the
// the ray is closest to the camera.
// .SECTION Caveats
// vlPicker and its subclasses will not pick actors that are "unpickable" 
// (see vlActor) or are fully transparent.
// .SECTION See Also
// vlPicker is used for quick picking. If you desire to pick points
// or cells, use the subclass vlPointPicker or vlCellPicker, respectively.
