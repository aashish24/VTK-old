// .NAME vtkRecursiveSphereDirectionEncoder - A direction encoder based on the recursive subdivision of an octahedron
// .SECTION Description
// vtkRecursiveSphereDirectionEncoder is a direction encoder which uses the 
// vertices of a recursive subdivision of an octahedron (with the vertices
// pushed out onto the surface of an enclosing sphere) to encode directions
// into a two byte value. 
//
// .SECTION see also
// vtkDirectionEncoder

// Construct the object. Initialize the index table which will be
// used to map the normal into a patch on the recursively subdivided
// sphere.

  // Description:
  // Get the decoded gradient table. There are 
  // this->GetNumberOfEncodedDirections() entries in the table, each
  // containing a normal (direction) vector. This is a flat structure - 
  // 3 times the number of directions floats in an array.
  float *GetDecodedGradientTable( void );

  // Description:
  // Set / Get the recursion depth for the subdivision. This
  // indicates how many time one triangle on the initial 8-sided
  // sphere model is replaced by four triangles formed by connecting
  // triangle edge midpoints. A recursion level of 0 yields 8 triangles
  // with 6 unique vertices. The normals are the vectors from the
  // sphere center through the vertices. The number of directions
  // will be 11 since the four normals with 0 z values will be
  // duplicated in the table - once with +0 values and the other
  // time with -0 values, and an addition index will be used to
  // represent the (0,0,0) normal. If we instead choose a recursion 
  // level of 6 (the maximum that can fit within 2 bytes) the number
  // of directions is 16643, with 16386 unique directions and a 
  // zero normal.
