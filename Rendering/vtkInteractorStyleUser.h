// .NAME vtkInteractorStyleUser - provides customizable interaction routines
// 
// .SECTION Description
// The most common way to customize user interaction is to write a subclass
// of vtkInteractorStyle: vtkInteractorStyleUser allows user interaction to
// be customized without subclassing.

  void StartUserInteraction();

  // Description:
  // Get the previous mouse position
