// .NAME vtkFrustumCoverageCuller - cull props based on frustum coverage
// .SECTION Description
// vtkFrustumCoverageCuller will cull props based on the coverage in
// the view frustum. The coverage is computed by enclosing the prop in
// a bounding sphere, projecting that to the viewing coordinate system, then
// taking a slice through the view frustum at the center of the sphere. This
// results in a circle on the plane slice through the view frustum. This
// circle is enclosed in a squared, and the fraction of the plane slice that
// this square covers is the coverage. This is a number between 0 and 1.
// If the number is less than the MinumumCoverage, the allocated render time
// for that prop is set to zero. If it is greater than the MaximumCoverage,
// the allocated render time is set to 1.0. In between, a linear ramp is used
// to convert coverage into allocated render time.
