// .NAME vtkWin32RenderWindowInteractor - provide an event driven interface 
// to the renderer
// .SECTION Description
// vtkWin32RenderWindowInteractor is a convenience object that provides event 
// event bindings to common graphics functions. For example, camera
// zoom-in/zoom-out, azimuth, and roll. It is one of the window system
// specific subclasses of vtkRenderWindowInteractor.

// .SECTION see also
// vtkRenderWindowInteractor vtkWin32OglrRenderWindow

// .SECTION Event Bindings
// Mouse bindings: Button 1 - rotate, Button 2 - pan, Button 3 - zoom
// The distance from the center of the renderer viewport determines
// how quickly to rotate, pan and zoom.
// Keystrokes:
//    r - reset camera view
//    w - turn all actors wireframe
//    s - turn all actors surface
//    e - exits
