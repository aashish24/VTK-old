// .NAME vtkWin32RenderWindowInteractor - provide an event driven interface 
// to the renderer
// .SECTION Description
// vtkWin32RenderWindowInteractor is a convenience object that provides event 
// event bindings to common graphics functions. For example, camera and actor
// functions such as zoom-in/zoom-out, azimuth, roll, and pan. It is one of
// the window system specific subclasses of vtkRenderWindowInteractor.

// Mouse bindings:
//    camera: Button 1 - rotate; Button 2 - pan; and Button 3 - zoom;
//            ctrl-Button 1 - spin.
//    actor:  Button 1 - rotate; Button 2 - pan; Button 3 - uniform scale;
//            ctrl-Button 1 - spin; ctrl-Button 2 - dolly.
//
// Camera mode is the default mode for compatibility reasons
//
// When "j" is pressed, the interaction models after a joystick. The distance
// from the center of the renderer viewport determines how quickly to rotate,
// pan, zoom, spin, and dolly.  This is the default mode for compatiblity
// reasons.  This is also known as position sensitive motion.
//
// When "t" is pressed, the interaction models after a trackball. Each mouse
// movement is used to move the actor or camera. When the mouse stops, the
// camera or actor motion is also stopped. This is also known as motion
// sensitive motion.
//
// Rotate, pan, and zoom work the same way as before.  Spin has two different
// interfaces depending on whether the interactor is in trackball or joystick
// mode.  In trackball mode, by moving the mouse around the camera or actor
// center in a circular motion, the camera or actor is spun.  In joystick mode
// by moving the mouse in the y direction, the actor or camera is spun. Scale
// dolly, and zoom all work in the same manner, that motion of mouse in y
// direction generates the transformation.
//
// There are no difference between camera and actor mode interactions, which
// means that the same events elicit the same responses
//
// Actor picking can be accomplished with the "p" key or with a mouse click
// in actor mode. 
//
// Keystrokes:
//    j - joystick-like mouse interactions
//    t - trackball-like mouse interactions
//    o - object / actor interaction
//    c - camera interaction
//    r - reset camera view
//    w - turn all actors wireframe
//    s - turn all actors surface
//    u - execute user defined function
//    p - pick actor under mouse pointer (if pickable)
//    3 - toggle in/out of 3D mode (if supported by renderer)
//    e - exits
//    q - exits
