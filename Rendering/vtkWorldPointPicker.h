// .NAME vtkWorldPointPicker - find world x,y,z corresponding to display x,y,z
// .SECTION Description
// vtkWorldPointPicker is used to find the x,y,z world coordinate of a
// screen x,y,z. This picker cannot pick actors and/or mappers, it
// simply computes an x-y-z coordinate in world space (so the actor
// and mapper are set to NULL).  

// .SECTION Caveats 
// The PickMethod is not invoked, but StartPickMethod and EndPickMethod are.

// .SECTION See Also 
// vtkPicker vtkCellPicker vtkPointPicker
