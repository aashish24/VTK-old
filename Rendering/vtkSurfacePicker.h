// .NAME vtkSurfacePicker - ray-cast picker for all kinds of Prop3Ds
// .SECTION Description
// vtkSurfacePicker is a subclass of vtkPicker that tries to be a little
// bit smarter and less generic than vtkCellPicker and vtkPointPicker.
// For vtkVolume objects, it shoots a ray into the volume and returns
// the point where the ray intersects an isosurface of a chosen opacity.
// For vtkImageActor objects, it intersects the ray with the displayed
// slice. For vtkActor objects, it works like vtkCellPicker but also
// returns the closest point within the picked cell.
// If the object's mapper has ClippingPlanes, then it takes the clipping
// into account, and will return the Id of the clipping plane that was
// intersected.
// For all prop types, it returns point and cell information, plus the
// normal of the surface that was intersected at the pick position.  For
// volumes and images, it also returns (i,j,k) coordinates for the point
// and the cell that were picked.

  // Description:
  // Perform pick operation with selection point provided. Normally the 
  // first two values are the (x,y) pixel coordinates for the pick, and
  // the third value is z=0. The return value will be non-zero if
  // something was successfully picked.

  // Description:
  // Add a locator for one of the data sets that will be included in the
  // scene.  This can dramatically increase performance for complex
  // objects.  If you try to add the same locator twice, the second addition
  // will be ignored.  You must either build the locator before doing the
  // pick, or turn on LazyEvaluation in the locator.

  // Set the opacity isovalue to use for defining volume surfaces.  The
  // pick will occur at the location along the pick ray where the product
  // of the scalar opacity and gradient opacity is equal to this isovalue.

  // is on by default.

  // Description:
  // Set whether to pick the clipping planes of props that have them.
  // If this is set, then the pick will be done on the clipping planes
  // rather than on the data. The GetClippingPlaneId() method will return
  // the index of the clipping plane of the vtkProp3D that was picked.
  // The picking of vtkImageActors is not influenced by this setting,
  // since they have no clipping planes.
  vtkSetMacro(PickClippingPlanes, int);

  // Description:
  // Get the index of the clipping plane that was intersected during
  // the pick.  This will be set regardless of whether PickClippingPlanes
  // is on.  The result will be -1 if the Prop3D that was picked
  // has no clipping planes, or if the ray didn't intersect the planes.

  // Description:
  // Return the normal of the picked surface at the PickPosition.  If no
  // surface was picked, the camera's view plane normal is returned.

  // Description:

  // coordinates.  The result is undefined if no prop was picked.

  // Description:
  // Get the structured coordinates of the point at the PickPosition.
  // Only valid for image actors and volumes with vtkImageData.

  // Description:
  // Get the structured coordinates of the cell at the PickPosition.
  // Only valid for image actors and volumes with vtkImageData.
  // Combine this with the PCoords to get the position within the cell.
  vtkGetVector3Macro(CellIJK, int);

  // Description:
  // Get the id of the picked point. If PointId = -1, nothing was picked.
  // This point will be a member of any cell that is picked.

  // Description:
  // Get the id of the picked cell. If CellId = -1, nothing was picked.

  // Description:
  // Get the subId of the picked cell. This is useful, for example, if
  // the data is made of triangle strips. If SubId = -1, nothing was picked.
  vtkGetMacro(SubId, int);

  // Description:
  // Get the parametric coordinates of the picked cell. Only valid if
  // a prop was picked.  The PCoords can be used to interpolate data
