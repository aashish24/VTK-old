// .NAME vtkOpenGLVolumeProVG500Mapper - Concrete class for VolumePRO mapper
//
// .SECTION Description
// vtkOpenGLVolumeProVG500Mapper is the concrete implementation of a 
// vtkVolumeProMapper based on the VG500 chip running with OpenGL. 
// Users should not create this class directly - a vtkVolumeProMapper will 
// automatically create the object of the right type.
//
// This class is not included in the contrib Makefile.in by default. If you
// want to add this class to your vtk build, you need to have the vli header
// and library files, and you will need to perform the following steps:
//
// 1. Make sure you are building with the contrib kit. On Unix add
//    --with-contrib to your configure line, on Windows check the
//   contrib box on PCMaker.
//
// 2. Edit the Makefile.in in contrib. Add the following three classes to
//    the CONCRETE list of classes: vtkVolumeProMapper, 
//    vtkVolumeProVG500Mapper, vtkOpenGLVolumeProVG500Mapper. Please be
//    certain that there are no spaces after the "\" that separates lines.
//
// 3. Either edit vtkVolumeProMapper.h and specify the include path
//    for vli.h, or copy the vli.h file to your contrib directory.
//
// 4. On Windows - add the vli.lib file to the Extra Linker Flags under
//    the Advanced Options. On Unix - add the vli shared object to the
//    KIT_LIBS in the Makefile.in in contrib.
//  
// 5. On Windows - make sure vli.dll is somewhere in your path before you
//    run vtk. You can put it in your vtkbin/lib or vtkbin/Debug/lib if
//    you want. On Unix - make sure the vli shared object is in your
//    shared library path before you run.
//
// 6. Reconfigure and rebuild vtk. You should now be able to create a
//    vtkVolumeProMapper which, if you have a VolumePRO board and the
//    device driver is running, should connect to the hardware and render
//    your volumes quickly.
//
// For more information on the VolumePRO hardware, please see:
//
//   http://www.3dvolumegraphics.com/3dvolumegraphics/product/index.htm
//
// If you encouter any problems with this class, please inform Kitware, Inc.
// at kitware@kitware.com.
