// .NAME vtkOpenGLVolumeProVG500Mapper - Concrete class for VolumePRO mapper
//
// .SECTION Description
// vtkOpenGLVolumeProVG500Mapper is the concrete implementation of a 
// vtkVolumeProMapper based on the VG500 chip running with OpenGL. 
// Users should not create this class directly - a vtkVolumeProMapper will 
// automatically create the object of the right type.
//
// This class is not included in the contrib Makefile.in by default. If you
// want to add this class to your vtk build, you need to have the vli header
// and library files.  Please see the vtkVolumeProVG500Mapper.h file for
// instructions on how to use the vli library with vtk.
//
// For more information on the VolumePRO hardware, please see:
//
//   http://www.3dvolumegraphics.com/3dvolumegraphics/product/index.htm
//
// If you encouter any problems with this class, please inform Kitware, Inc.
// at kitware@kitware.com.
