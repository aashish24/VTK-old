// .NAME vtkVolumeRayCastFunction - a superclass for ray casting functions

// .SECTION Description
// vtkVolumeRayCastFunction is a superclass for ray casting functions that 
// can be used within a vtkVolumeRayCastMapper. This includes for example,
// vtkVolumeRayCastCompositeFunction, vtkVolumeRayCastMIPFunction, and
// vtkVolumeRayCastIsosurfaceFunction.

  // Do the basic initialization. This includes saving the parameters
  // passed in into local variables, as well as grabbing some useful
  // info from the volume property and normal encoder. This initialize
  // routine is called once per render. It also calls the 
  // SpecificFunctionInitialize of the subclass function.
