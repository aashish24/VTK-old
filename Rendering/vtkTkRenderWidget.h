// .SECTION Description
// vtkTkRenderWidget is a Tk widget that you can render into. It has a 
// GetRenderWindow method that returns a vtkRenderWindow. This can then
// be used to create a vtkRenderer and etc. You can also specify a 
// vtkRenderWindow to be used when creating the widget by using
// the -rw option. It also takes -width and -height options.
// Events can be bound on this widget just like any other Tk widget.
