// .NAME vtkWin32ImageMapper - (obsolete) 2D image display support for Microsoft windows
// .SECTION Description
// vtkWin32ImageMapper is a concrete subclass of vtkImageMapper that
// renders images under Microsoft windows.

// .SECTION See Also
// vtkImageMapper

  // Description:
  // The ImageMappers convert ImageData into a greyscale image when a single
  // scalar component is present.
  // If a lookuptable is supplied, values are mapped through the lookuptable
  // to generate a colour image. If the number of scalar components is greater
  // then one, the lookuptable is ignored. If the lookuptable is NULL, a default
  // greyscale image is generated. Users should ensure that the range of the
  // lookuptable is {0,255} for full colour effects
  vtkSetObjectMacro(LookupTable, vtkLookupTable);

  // Description:
  // CreateBitmapObject and GenerateBitmapData are utility functions which
  // allow one to hook into the display routines and provide the user
  // with an easy way of converting an ImageData object into a windows
  // bitmap object. They are also used internally by the mapper and should not
  // be modified or used standalone alone without caution.
