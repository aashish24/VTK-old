// .NAME vtkLODActor - an actor that supports multiple levels of detail
// .SECTION Description
// vtkLODActor is an actor that stores multiple Levels of Detail and can
// automatically switch between them. It selects which level of detail
// to use based on how much time it has been allocated to render. 
// Currently a very simple method of TotalTime/NumberOfActors is used.
// In the future this should be modified to dynamically allocate the
// rendering time between different actors based on their needs.
// There are currently three levels of detail. The top level is just
// the normal data.  The lowest level of detail is a simple bounding
// box outline of the actor. The middle level of detail is a point
// cloud of a fixed number of points that have been randomly sampled
// from the Mappers input data.  Point attributes are copied over to
// the point cloud.  These two lower levels of detail are accomplished by
// creating instances of a vtkOutlineFilter, vtkGlyph3D, and vtkPointSource.
