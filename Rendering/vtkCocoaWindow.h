// .NAME vtkCocoaWindow - Access Cocoa NSWindow context
//
// .SECTION Description
// This class is a subclass of Cocoa's NSWindow; it uses Objective-C++.
// This class overrides NSWindow's close method to quit the application
// when the close box is pressed by the user. A vtkCocoaWindow is created
// automatically by vtk by default, but the programmer can override this
// behaviour, see vtkCocoaRenderWindow's SetWindowId().
// Note that this class previously contained much more functionality
// but that functionality has been moved to other classes.
 

// .SECTION See Also
// vtkCocoaGLView vtkCocoaRenderWindow
