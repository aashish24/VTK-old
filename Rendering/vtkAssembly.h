// .NAME vtkAssembly - create hierarchies of actors
// .SECTION Description
// vtkAssembly is a convienence object that groups actors together. The 
// group can be used to transform multiple actors simultaneously; or to 
// assign properties or other actor attributes such as visibility or a 
// texture map. Groups can be nested to form hierarchies.
//
// A vtkAssembly object can be used in place of an vtkActor since it is a 
// subclass of vtkActor. The difference is that vtkAssembly maintains a list
// of actor instances (its "parts") that form the assembly. Then, any 
// operation that modifies the parent assembly will modify all its parts.
// Note that this process is recursive: you can create groups consisting
// of assemblies and/or actors to arbitrary depth.
//
// Actor's (or assemblies) that compose an assembly need not be added to 
// a renderer's list of actors, as long as the parent assembly is in the
// list of actors. This is because they are automatically renderered 
// during the hierarchical traversal process.

// .SECTION Caveats
// Collections of assemblies are slower to render than an equivalent list
// of actors. This is because to support arbitrary nesting of assemblies, 
// the state of the assemblies (i.e., transformations and properties) must
// be propagated through the assembly hierarchy. 
//
// Assemblies can consist of hierarchies of assemblies, where one actor or
// assembly used in one hierarchy is also used in other hierarchies. However, 
// make that there are no cycles (e.g., parent->child->parent), this will
// cause program failure.
