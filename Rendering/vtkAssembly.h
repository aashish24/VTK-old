// .NAME vtkAssembly - create hierarchies of vtkProp3Ds (transformable props)
// .SECTION Description
// vtkAssembly is an object that groups vtkProp3Ds, its subclasses, and
// other assemblies into a tree-like hierarchy. The vtkProp3Ds and
// assemblies can then be transformed together by transforming just the root
// assembly of the hierarchy.
//
// A vtkAssembly object can be used in place of an vtkProp3D since it is a
// subclass of vtkProp3D. The difference is that vtkAssembly maintains a list
// of vtkProp3D instances (its "parts") that form the assembly. Then, any
// operation that transforms (i.e., scales, rotates, translates) the parent
// assembly will transform all its parts.  Note that this process is
// recursive: you can create groups consisting of assemblies and/or
// vtkProp3Ds to arbitrary depth.
//
// To add an assembly to the renderer's list of props, you only need to
// add the root of the assembly. During rendering, the parts of the
// assembly are rendered during a hierarchical traversal process.

// .SECTION Caveats
// Collections of assemblies are slower to render than an equivalent list
// of actors. This is because to support arbitrary nesting of assemblies, 
// the state of the assemblies (i.e., transformation matrices) must
// be propagated through the assembly hierarchy. 
//
// Assemblies can consist of hierarchies of assemblies, where one actor or
// assembly used in one hierarchy is also used in other hierarchies. However, 
// make that there are no cycles (e.g., parent->child->parent), this will
// cause program failure.
//
// If you wish to create assemblies without any transformation (using the 
// assembly strictly as a grouping mechanism), then you may wish to
// consider using vtkPropAssembly.
