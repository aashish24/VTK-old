// .NAME vtkAssembly - create hierarchies of actors
// .SECTION Description
// vtkAssembly is an object that groups actors and other assemblies into
// a tree-like hierarchy. The actors and assemblies can then be transformed
// together by transforming just the root assembly of the hierarchy.
//
// A vtkAssembly object can be used in place of an vtkActor since it is a 
// subclass of vtkActor. The difference is that vtkAssembly maintains a list
// of actor instances (its "parts") that form the assembly. Then, any 
// operation that modifies the parent assembly will modify all its parts.
// Note that this process is recursive: you can create groups consisting
// of assemblies and/or actors to arbitrary depth.
//
// Actor's (or assemblies) that compose an assembly need not be added to 
// a renderer's list of actors, as long as the parent assembly is in the
// list of actors. This is because they are automatically renderered 
// during the hierarchical traversal process.
//
// Since a vtkAssembly object is a derived class of vtkActor, it has properties
// and possibly a mapper. During the rendering process, if a mapper is associated
// with the assembly, it is rendered with these properties. Otherwise, the 
// properties have no effect (i.e., on the children of the assembly).

// .SECTION Caveats
// Collections of assemblies are slower to render than an equivalent list
// of actors. This is because to support arbitrary nesting of assemblies, 
// the state of the assemblies (i.e., transformation matrices) must
// be propagated through the assembly hierarchy. 
//
// Assemblies can consist of hierarchies of assemblies, where one actor or
// assembly used in one hierarchy is also used in other hierarchies. However, 
// make that there are no cycles (e.g., parent->child->parent), this will
// cause program failure.

  // properties (depending upon the ApplyProperty and ApplyTransform ivars).
  // Note that the part appears as an actor. These methods should be contrasted
  // to those that traverse the list of parts using GetParts(). GetParts() returns
  // a list of children of this assembly, not necessarily with the correct
  // transformation or properties. To use these methods - first invoke 
  // InitPartTraversal() followed by repeated calls to GetNextPart().
