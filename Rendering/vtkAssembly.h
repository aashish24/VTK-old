// .NAME vtkAssembly - create hierarchies of actors
// .SECTION Description
// vtkAssembly is a convienence object that groups actors together. The 
// group can be used to transform multiple actors simultaneously; or to 
// assign properties or other actor attributes such as visibility or a 
// texture map. Groups can be nested to form hierarchies.
//
// A vtkAssembly object can be used in place of an vtkActor since it is a 
// subclass of vtkActor. The difference is that vtkAssembly maintains a list
// of actor instances (its "parts") that form the assembly. Then, any 
// operation that modifies the parent assembly will modify all its parts.
// Note that this process is recursive: you can create groups consisting
// of assemblies and/or actors to arbitrary depth.
//
// Actor's (or assemblies) that compose an assembly need not be added to 
// a renderer's list of actors, as long as the parent assembly is in the
// list of actors. This is because they are automatically renderered 
// during the hierarchical traversal process.

// .SECTION Caveats
// The application of properties is order dependent!!! By order we mean the
// order in which the assemblies are rendered. Each time an assembly is 
// rendered, it propagates its properties through its part hierarchy. As a
// result, if an assembly (or actor) is part of two different assemblies
// (say a1 and a2), and the list of actors is reversed (say from a1,a2 to
// a2,a1), then the final image may change.
//
// Actor's that form parts of assemblies cannot use the UserDefined matrix
// defined in vtkActor. This is because this ivar is used during the assembly
// concatenation process.
