// .NAME vtkPolyDataMapper - map vtkPolyData to graphics primitives
// .SECTION Description
// vtkPolyDataMapper is a class that maps polygonal data (i.e., vtkPolyData)
// to graphics primitives. vtkPolyDataMapper serves as a superclass for
// device-specific poly data mappers, that actually do the mapping to the
// rendering/graphics hardware/software.
