// .NAME vtkPolyDataMapper - map vtkPolyData to graphics primitives
// .SECTION Description
// vtkPolyDataMapper is a class that maps polygonal data (i.e., vtkPolyData)
// to graphics primitives. vtkPolyDataMapper serves as a superclass for
// device-specific poly data mappers, that actually do the mapping to the
// rendering/graphics hardware/software.
// It is now possible to set a memory limit for the pipeline in the mapper.
// If the total estimated memory usage of the pipeline is larger than
// this limit, the mapper will divide the data into pieces and render
// each in a for loop.
