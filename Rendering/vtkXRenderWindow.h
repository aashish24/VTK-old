// .NAME vtkXRenderWindow - a rendering window for the X Window system
// .SECTION Description
// vtkXRenderWindow is a subclass of the abstract class
// vtkRenderWindow. vtkXRenderWindow interfaces to the X Window system and
// provides some methods that are common to any vtkRenderWindow
// subclass that renders under X windows. The vtkXRenderWindowInteractor
// makes heavy use of these common methods.
