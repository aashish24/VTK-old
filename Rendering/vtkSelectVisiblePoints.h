// .NAME vtkSelectVisiblePoints - extract points that are visible (based on z-buffer calculation)
// .SECTION Description
// vtkSelectVisiblePoints is a filter that selects points based on
// whether they are visible or not. Visibility is determined by
// accessing the z-buffer of a rendering window. (The position of each
// input point is converted into display coordinates, and then the
// z-value at that point is obtained. If within the user-specified
// tolerance, the point is considered visible.)
//
// Points that are visible (or if the ivar SelectInvisible is on,
// invisible points) are passed to the output. Associated data
// attributes are passed to the output as well.
//
// This filter also allows you to specify a rectangular window in display
// (pixel) coordinates in which the visible points must lie. This can be
// used as a sort of local "brushing" operation to select just data within
// a window.
// 

// .SECTION Caveats
// You must carefully synchronize the execution of this filter. The
// filter refers to a renderer, which is modified every time a render
// occurs. Therefore, the filter is always out of date, and always
// executes. You may have to perform two rendering passes, or if you
// are using this filter in conjunction with vtkLabeledPointMapper,
// things work out because 2D rendering occurs after the 3D rendering.
