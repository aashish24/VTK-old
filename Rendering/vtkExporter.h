// .NAME vtkExporter - abstract class to write a scene to a file
// .SECTION Description
// vtkExporter is an abstract class that exports a scene to a file. It
// is very similar to vtkWriter except that a writer only writes out
// the geometric and topological data for an object, where an exporter
// can write out material properties, lighting, camera parameters etc.
// The concrete subclasses of this class may not write out all of this
// information. For example vtkOBJExporter writes out Wavefront obj files
// which do not include support for camera parameters.
//
// vtkExporter provides the convenience methods StartWrite() and EndWrite().
// These methods are executed before and after execution of the Write() 
// method. You can also specify arguments to these methods.
// This class defines SetInput and GetInput methods which take or return
// a vtkRenderWindow.  
// .SECTION Caveats
// Every subclass of vtkExporter must implement a WriteData() method. 

// .SECTION See Also
// vtkOBJExporter vtkRenderWindow vtkWriter
