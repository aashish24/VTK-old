// .NAME vtkPointPicker - select a point by shooting a ray into graphics window
// .SECTION Description
// vtkPointPicker is used to select a point by shooting a ray into graphics
// window and intersecting with actor's defining geometry - specifically 
// its points. Beside returning coordinates, actor and mapper, vtkPointPicker
// returns the id of the closest point within the tolerance along the pick ray.
// .SECTION See Also
// For quick picking, see vtkPicker. To uniquely pick actors, see vtkCellPicker.
