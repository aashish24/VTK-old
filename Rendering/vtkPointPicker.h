// .NAME vtkPointPicker - select a point by shooting a ray into a graphics window
// .SECTION Description
// vtkPointPicker is used to select a point by shooting a ray into a graphics
// window and intersecting with actor's defining geometry - specifically 
// its points. Beside returning coordinates, actor, and mapper, vtkPointPicker
// returns the id of the closest point within the tolerance along the pick ray.

// .SECTION See Also
// vtkPicker vtkCellPicker.
