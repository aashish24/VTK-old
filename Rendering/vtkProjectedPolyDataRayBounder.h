// .NAME vtkProjectedPolyDataRayBounder - Bound a ray according to polydata
// .SECTION Description
// The vtkProjectedPolyDataRayBounder can be used to clip viewing rays
// against the polygons in a vtkPolyData. This is done by projecting the
// vtkPolyData twice - first capturing a near Z buffer, then capturing 
// a far Z buffer. The values from the Z buffers are decoded according to
// the current viewing transformation, and the decoded pairs of values
// (near,far) are returned as distance from the view point for perspective
// viewing, or distance from the view plane for parallel viewing.
// 

// .SECTION see also
// vtkOpenGLProjectedPolyDataRayBounder
