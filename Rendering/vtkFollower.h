// .NAME vtkFollower - a subclass of actor that always faces the camera
// .SECTION Description
// vtkFollower is a subclass of vtkActor that always follows its specified 
// camera. More specifically it will not change its position or scale,
// but it will continually update its orientation so that it is right side
// up and facing the camera. This is typically used for text labels in a
// scene. All of the adjustments that can be made to an actor also will
// take effect with a follower.  So, if you change the orientation of the
// follower by 90 degrees, then it will follow the camera, but be off by 
// 90 degrees.

// .SECTION see also
// vtkActor vtkCamera
