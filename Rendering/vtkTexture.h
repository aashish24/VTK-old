// .NAME vtkTexture - handles properties associated with a texture map
// .SECTION Description
// vtkTexture is an object that handles loading and binding of texture
// maps. It obtains its data from a StructuredPoints input. Multiple 
// actors using the same texture map should share the same vtkTexture
// object.  This reduces the amount of memory being used. Currently
// only 2D etxture maps are supported event though the data pipeline
// supports 1,2, and 3D texture coordinates.
// .SECTION See Also
// See vtkRenderer for definition of #define's.
