// .NAME vtkOBJExporter - export a scene into Wavefront format.
// .SECTION Description
// vtkOBJExporter is a concrete subclass of vtkExporter that writes wavefront
// .OBJ files in ASCII form. It also writes out a mtl file that contains the
// material properties. The filenames are derived by appending the .obj and
// .mtl suffix onto the user specified FilePrefix.
