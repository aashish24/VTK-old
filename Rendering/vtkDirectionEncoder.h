// .NAME vtkDirectionEncoder - encode a direction into a one or two byte value
//
// .SECTION Description
// Given a direction, encode it into an integer value. This value should
// be less than 65536, which is the maximum number of encoded directions
// supported by this superclass. A direction encoded is used to encode
// normals in a volume for use during volume rendering, and the
// amount of space that is allocated per normal is 2 bytes.
// This is an abstract superclass - see the subclasses for specific 
// implementation details.
//
// .SECTION see also
// vtkRecursiveSphereDirectionEncoder
