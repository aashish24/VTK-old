// The out cull method is where the culling occurs in this class.
// The coverage is computed for each actor, and a resulting allocated
// render time is computed. This is multiplied by the current allocated
// render time of the actor. After this, actors with no allocated time are
// removed from the list (and the list length is shortened) to make sure
// that they are not considered again by another culler or for rendering.
