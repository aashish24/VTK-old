<h1><A NAME="Introduction">Introduction</h1>
The origin of VTK is with the textbook "The Visualization Toolkit, an
Object-Oriented Approach to 3D Graphics" published by Prentice Hall
(ISBN 013199837-4). VTK has grown (since its initial release in 1994)
to a world-wide user base in the commercial, academic, and research 
communities.<p>

This is VTK version 3.2. For more information and a FAQ see our web page at
<A HREF="http://www.kitware.com">http://www.kitware.com</A><p>

<HR>
<h1><A NAME="Documentation">Documentation</h1>

The ideal way to learn about the software is from the book it is designed to
support.  You should be able to get the book from any local bookstore or from
our web page. The web page also contains some html reference pages for the
objects in VTK as well as a FAQ.

<h1><A NAME="Installation">Installation</h1>

The Visualization Toolkit can be built on both Unix and PC 
(Windows 95/98/NT/2000) systems.  VTK uses <A HREF="http://public.kitware.com/CMake">CMake</A>
for its build process.  To build VTK for UNIX or Windows, you will first have to install CMake.
You can download CMake from: <A HREF="http://public.kitware.com/CMake"</A>http://public.kitware.com/CMake </A>
The following instructions assume that cmake is already installed.
<p>

<h3><A NAME="Unix">Unix Installation</h3>
The following instructions only apply to UNIX systems.  
The windows source distribution will be released in a different file.<p>

First we will give you the quick and dirty way to build VTK.
If you have OpenGL do the following:<p>

If you will be using C++ as your development language:
<pre>
  1) untar the src files
  2) untar the data files
  3) cd vtk
  4) cmake
  5) read and edit CMakeCache.txt adding options like python or tcl/tk support.
  6) cmake
  7) make
</pre>

It is a very good idea to tell cmake what C and C++ compilers
you will be using. This can avoid many build problems.
On most systems you can pass this information to configure in the 
following way:
<pre>
env CXX=/your/C++/compiler CC=/your/c/compiler cmake
</pre>
otherwise you must set CXX and CC in your environment and then
run configure.<p>


Now here is the slightly more detailed description of the build process.<p>

There are a couple of options in building the software that you need to
decide on. First you need to decide if you are going to use the Mesa
rendering library developed by Brian Paul.  This is a software renderer that
VTK can use on Xwindows based workstations.  If your workstation doesn't
support OpenGL then you will need Mesa because you have
no other choice :-) If you want to build the VTK interpreter then you will
need to have Tcl8.2.3 and Tk8.2.3. <p>

Look to http://www.scriptics.com/ for information about getting
Tcl and Tk. To obtain a copy of Mesa, written by Brian Paul, you can
visit http://www.ssec.wisc.edu/~brianp/Mesa.html.<p>

To build VTK in the distribution directory just type cmake
You can turn on tcl or mesa by editing the CMakeCache.txt file
if you would like to use those packages as well. Building VTK for multiple 
architectures will be discussed later.<p>

If you are planning to build VTK for multiple architectures then you can
either make a copy of the entire VTK tree for each architecture and then
follow the instructions above. Or if you have gmake, you can have one copy of
the VTK tree and compile it in a different manner. Instead of running
cmake from the VTK directory, create a new directory where you have some
free disk space (not in the VTK tree), a possible name would be
vtk-solaris. cd into this directory and then run configure similar to the
following example:
<pre>
ls /home/joe_user
    vtk vtk-solaris vtk-sgi

cd vtk-solaris
cmake /home/joe_user/vtk
</pre>
This will create makefiles in the vtk-solaris directory.  Then you can run
gmake in vtk-solaris to compile VTK.  Repeate this process for each
architecture you wish to build.<p>

<h3><A NAME="Cygwin">Cygwin Installation</h3>
The build process for Cygwin is almost exactly the same as the UNIX build process.

If you will be using C++ as your development language:
<pre>
  1) untar the src files
  2) untar the data files
  3) cd vtk
  4) cmake 
  5) read and edit CMakeCache.txt adding options like python or tcl/tk support.
  6) cmake
  7) make
</pre>


<h3><A NAME="PC">PC Installation</h3>
    The PC build process uses the CMake GUI CMakeSetup. Then you use the compiler make utility
    to compile as follows.
    <pre>
    1. Install vtk3.2 distribution by unzipping into the appropriate directory.

    2. Execute CMakeSetup. This will pop-up a little
       GUI that allows you to tailor the build. It then starts
       building .dsw and .dsp files for microsoft, or makefiles for borland.
        You'll have to tell CMakeSetup
       where you've placed your VTK source code, and where to build
       the object code and dll's (we'll call it "vtkbin").

    3. When CMakeSetup completes, start up msdev and load VTK.dsw.
       Select ALL_BUILD project, and build it.

</pre>
We recommend a 300MByte minimum swap size or you'll have trouble
during the link phase.<p>

<HR>
<h1><A NAME="Execution">Execution</h1>

Many of the examples require the data found in vtk20data.part1.tar.gz
through vtk20data.part4.tar.gz, plus the additional file
MissingData.tar.gz. (These files can be found at
ftp://public.kitware.com/pub/vtk, or in the vtkdata/ directory if this
document is part of the CD-ROM distribution.) 
The examples that require data look for it in ../../../vtkdata.
<p>

To run the cc examples just type their name.  To run the tcl examples,
(assuming that you built the tcl stuff) type 
<pre>
../../../vtk/tcl/vtk mace.tcl 
</pre>

<HR>
<h1><A NAME="Problems">Common Problems</h1>
  <ul>
  <li>I got a "warning: no configuration information is in tcl" from configure.
      This is correct and is supposed to happen.
  <li>Strange compile errors on Unix. Make sure that you specify the
      environment variables CXX and CC prior to running configure.
      (If you have already run configure, do a "make clean" to remove
      the cached configure information.)
  <li>Errors on Tcl or Tk include files. Make sure that you edit
      CMakeCache.txt to point to the correct location.
  <li>Errors on Tcl or Tk libraries. Make sure that you edit
      CMakeCache.txt to point to the correct location.
  <li>Link errors on Windows platforms. Make sure that the swap space is
      at least 300 MByte.
  </ul>

<HR>
<h1><A NAME="NewClass">Adding A New Class</h1>
<pre>
1) create the .cxx and .h file for the new class in one of the existing 
   directories. We recommend that you use the local/ directory.
2) edit CMakeLists.txt for that directory and follow the instructions in
   there. You will need to add the class in only one place.
3) you will need to rerun cmake (Unix) or CMakeSetup (Windows)
4) then make/gmake (Unix) or msdev (Windows).
