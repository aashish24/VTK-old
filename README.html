<h1><A NAME="Introduction">Introduction</h1>
VTK is an open-source software system for image processing, 3D graphics, and
visualization. VTK includes many advanced algorithms (e.g., surface
reconstruction, implicit modelling, decimation) and rendering techniques
(e.g., volume rendering, LOD control).<p>

VTK is used by academicians for teaching and research; by government research
institutions such as Los Alamos National Lab in the US or CINECA in Italy; and
by many commercial firms who use VTK to build or extend products.<p>

The origin of VTK is with the textbook "The Visualization Toolkit, an
Object-Oriented Approach to 3D Graphics" originally published by 
Prentice Hall and now published by Kitware, Inc. (Third Edition 
ISBN 1-930934-07-6). VTK has grown (since its initial release in 1994)
to a world-wide user base in the commercial, academic, and research 
communities.<p>

This README is written for VTK version 4.2 and greater. For more information,
additional resources, and the FAQ see the web page at 
<A HREF="http://www.vtk.org">http://www.vtk.org</A><p>

<h1><A NAME="Organization">Organization</h1>
The VTK 4.2 source code repository is organized into four major sections.
  <ul>
  <li>The source code is found in the directories Common, Rendering,
         Filtering, Graphics, Imaging, Hybrid, Parallel, and Patented.<p>
         <ul>
         <li><b>Common</b>- Core classes
         <li><b>Rendering</b>- Classes used to render
         <li><b>Filtering</b>- Abstract superclasses for filtering data
         <li><b>Graphics</b>- Filters that process 3D data
         <li><b>Imaging</b>- Specialized image processing filters
         <li><b>IO</b>- Classes for reading abd writing data
         <li><b>Hybrid</b>- Complex classes that depend on imaging and graphics
         <li><b>Parallel</b>- Parallel processing support such as MPI
         <li><b>Patented</b>- Patented classes, to be used in 
         commercial applications only with a license
         </ul>
         </li><p>
  <li><B>Examples</B> that are reasonably well documented are found in the
         VTK/Examples directory. You may wish to start with the examples
         found in the Tutorial directory.<p></li>
  <li>The <B>Utilities</B> directory includes things like jpeg, png, 
         and zlib source code. This code is used by VTK in various ways 
         (reading/writing data, etc.)<p></li>
  <li>The <B>Wrapping</B> directory contains code related to VTK's automated
         wrapping process. The wrapping process automatically generates
         Tcl, Python, and/or Java bindings depending on how the build
         process is configured.<p></li>
  </ul>

There are hundreds of testing examples located in the Testing/ directory
under each source code directory (e.g., Graphics/Testing). These are 
undocumented tests but can be helpful in some cases.<p>

<h1><A NAME="Documentation">Documentation</h1>

The ideal way to learn about the software is from two books: 
<i>The Visualization Toolkit, An Object-Oriented Approach to 3D Graphics</i>
and <i>The VTK User's Guide</i> both published by Kitware, Inc. (Note:
<i>The Visualization Toolkit</i> was originally published by Prentice-Hall,
the third edition is published by Kitware.)

<h1><A NAME="Installation">Installation</h1>

The Visualization Toolkit can be built on Unix, PC 
(Windows 95/98/NT/2000/XP) and Mac OSX Jaguar (or greater) systems.  
VTK uses <A HREF="http://www.cmake.org">CMake</A>
for its build process.  To build VTK for UNIX or Windows, you will first 
have to install CMake. You can download CMake from: 
<A HREF="http://www.cmake.org"</A>http://www.cmake.org</A>
The following instructions assume that cmake is already installed.
<p>

<h3><A NAME="Unix">Unix Installation</h3><p>
The following instructions only apply to UNIX systems.  

First we will give you the quick and dirty way to build VTK. Begin
by telling Cmake what C and C++ compilers
you will be using. This can avoid many build problems.
On most systems you can pass this information to CMake in the 
following way:
<pre>
  env CXX=/your/C++/compiler CC=/your/c/compiler cmake
</pre>
otherwise you must set the CXX and CC environment variables and then
run ccmake (or cmake -i).<p>

If you will be using C++ as your development language (no Tcl/Tk, Python or Java support):
<pre>
  1) untar the src files
  2) untar the data files
  3) cd VTK
  4) cmake -i (run cmake in wizard mode, where you have to answer 
     questions about the build)
or
  4) ccmake (run the terminal based interface to cmake where you interactively
     change build options)
  5) if necessary change build options
  6) make
</pre>

Note that this will create the binaries (i.e., object code, libraries, and
executables) in the same directory as the source code. You can also build
VTK out of source in a separate directory (this is particularly convenient
when building VTK on multiple architectures). Instead of running CMake 
from the VTK directory, create a new directory with enough disk space
(not in the VTK tree) such as vtk-solaris. cd into this directory and 
then run CMake similar to the following example:

<pre>
  ls /home/joe_user
      vtk vtk-solaris vtk-sgi

  cd vtk-solaris
  ccmake /home/joe_user/VTK
or
  cmake -i /home/joe_user/VTK
</pre>

This will create makefiles in the vtk-solaris directory.  Then you can run
make in vtk-solaris to compile VTK.  Repeate this process for each
architecture you wish to build.<p>

If you want to build the Tcl-based VTK interpreter then you will
need to have Tcl and Tk (8.2 or newer). Look to <A href="http://www.scriptics.com">http://www.scriptics.com</A>
for information about getting Tcl and Tk. To turn on Tcl wrapping,
set VTK_WRAP_TCL to ON during the configuration process (as a post-build step, you might want to check the <A href="Wrapping/Tcl/README">Wrapping/Tcl/README</A> file). You will then have
to set the values for Tcl/Tk include directories and libraries.

<P>
If you want to use VTK from <A href="http://www.python.org">Python</A>
you will need to have Python installed.  To turn on Python wrapping,
set VTK_WRAP_PYTHON to ON during the configuration process and then
set the values for the Python related directories and libraries.  If
you want to use Tkinter with VTK-Python then you should also turn on
Tcl wrapping by setting VTK_WRAP_TCL to ON.  Make sure that the Tcl/Tk
libraries that you set correspond to the same version used by Tkinter.
Note that the VTK-Python modules are not installed by default via
'make install'.  The <A
href="Wrapping/Python/README.txt">Wrapping/Python/README.txt</A> file
documents the installation procedure and the VTK-Python modules.
</P>

<h3><A NAME="Cygwin">Cygwin Installation</h3><p>
The build process for Cygwin is almost exactly the same as the UNIX build process
(see previous section)
<p>
If you will be using C++ as your development language (no Tcl/Tk, Python or Java support):
<pre>
  1) untar the src files
  2) untar the data files
  3) cd VTK
  4) cmake -i (run cmake in wizard mode, where you have to answer questions 
     about the build)
or
  4) ccmake (run the terminal based interface to cmake where you interactively
     change build options)
  5) if necessary change build options
  6) make
</pre>

For Tcl/Tk support, you have to install the cygwin sources for Tcl/Tk, then set
the TK_*_PATH variables to apropriate locations. For example if the TCL/TK
cygwin version you have is 20030214-1, then set the following options:

<pre>
TK_INCLUDE_PATH /usr/src/tcltk-20030214-1/tk/generic/;/usr/src/tcltk-20030214-1/tcl/generic/
TK_INTERNAL_PATH /usr/src/tcltk-20030214-1/tk/win/
TK_XLIB_PATH /usr/src/tcltk-20030214-1/tk/xlib
</pre>

Also, if you have several versions of TCL installed on the computer, where some of them are regular Windows binaries, and some are Cygwin, make sure to set the TCL_TCLSH to point to the right one.

<h3><A NAME="PC">PC Installation</h3><p>
    The PC build process uses the CMake GUI CMakeSetup. Then you use the 
    compiler make utility to compile as follows.
  <pre>
  1) Install the VTK 4.2 distribution by unzipping into the 
     appropriate directory.

  2) Execute CMakeSetup. This will pop-up a little
     GUI that allows you to tailor the build. It then starts
     building .dsw and .dsp files for Microsoft, or makefiles for Borland.
     You'll have to tell CMakeSetup where you've placed your VTK source 
     code, and where to build the object code and dll's 
     (we'll call it "vtkbin").

  3) When CMakeSetup completes, start up msdev and load VTK.dsw.
     Select ALL_BUILD project, and build it.

</pre>
We recommend a 300MByte minimum swap size or you'll have trouble
during the link phase.<p>

<HR>
<h1><A NAME="Problems">Common Problems</h1>
  <ul>
  <li>Strange compile errors on Unix. Make sure that you specify the
      environment variables CXX and CC prior to running CMake.
      (If you have already run CMake, do a "make clean" to remove
      the cached CMake information.)
  <li>Errors on Tcl or Tk include files. Make sure that you edit
      CMakeCache.txt to point to the correct location.
  <li>Errors on Tcl or Tk libraries. Make sure that you edit
      CMakeCache.txt to point to the correct location.
  <li>Link errors on Windows platforms. Make sure that the swap space is
      at least 300 MByte.
  <li>Link error with borland: TCL82.LIB contains invalid OMF record, 
      type 0x21 (possibly COFF). You have to convert Tcl libraires 
      from coff to omf with the Borland utilitiy coff2omf. Once you 
      have created OMF versions, re-run cmake to tell it where the Borland
      versions of Tcl and Tk are located. Also, make sure that you are using
      Tcl/Tk 8.3.2.
  </ul>

<h1><A NAME="Data">Getting Data and Test Images</h1>

Many of the examples require data. There are two ways to get data. The
first is to download the file VTKData.tgz. The second is to access the
data via CVS checkout. The CVS checkout also includes many test images
used by the testing process (see <A href="http://public.kitware.com/dashboard.php">http://public.kitware.com/dashboard.php</A>).
These can be used if you wish to test VTK or submit testing dashboards. 
The VTKData.tgz contains only data in compressed form is therefore can
be obtained much faster.

<pre>
  1) Download the data at ftp://public.kitware.com/pub/vtk/VTKData.tgz

  2) Checkout the data from CVS using the folling commands:
     cvs -d :pserver:anonymous@public.kitware.com:/vtk/cvsroot login
        (respond with password vtk)
     cvs -d :pserver:anonymous@public.kitware.com:/vtk/cvsroot checkout VTKData
</pre>

<HR>
<h1><A NAME="Running">Running VTK</h1>

Many C++ examples will be compiled if BUILD_TESTING and/or BUILD_EXAMPLES are
enabled in CMake. To run these C++ examples just type their name. (They will
be found in the binary build directory.) If you have built shared libraries,
make sure the PATH environment variable (Windows) or the LD_LIBRARY_PATH
(Unix) point to the shared libraries.

If you have enabled Tcl wrapping, you will want to set TCLLIBPATH to point to
the VTK/Wrapping/Tcl directory and check the instructions located in the <A
href="Wrapping/Tcl/README">Wrapping/Tcl/README</A> file. You will then run
the VTK executable found in the bin directory where the code was
compiled. Assuming that the executable VTK is in your path, or has been
aliased, you would type:
<pre>
  vtk mace.tcl 
</pre>
Note that most Tcl scripts allow you to type "u" in the render window to
obtain an interpreter. You can use the interpreter to modify the application
at run-time.

<P>
If you have enabled Python Wrapping you should read the instructions
located in the <A
href="Wrapping/Python/README.txt">Wrapping/Python/README.txt</A> file.
</P>

<HR>
<h1><A NAME="NewClass">Writing Your Own Class</h1> There are several ways to
extend VTK. The simplest way is, in your own code, create classes that
inherit from the appropriate VTK classes.  Please see the
<a href="Examples/Build/vtkLocal/README"><code>vtkLocal</code></a> example
for instructions to build your classes outside VTK.
