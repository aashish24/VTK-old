// .NAME vtkVRMLImporter - imports VRML 2.0 files.
// .SECTION Description
//
// vtkVRMLImporter imports VRML 2.0 files into vtk.
// .SECTION Caveats
//
// These nodes are currently supported:
//	Appearance				IndexedFaceSet
//	Box								IndexedLineSet
//	Color							Material
//	Cone							Shape
//	Coordinate				Sphere
//	Cylinder					Transform
//	DirectionalLight
// As you can see this implementation focuses on getting the geometry translated.
// The routes and scripting nodes are ignored since they deal with directly
// accessing a nodes internal structure based on the VRML spec. Since this is a
// translation the internal datastructures differ greatly from the VRML spec and
// the External Authoring Interface (see the VRML spec). The DEF/USE mechanism does
// allow the Vtk user to extract objects from the scene and directly manipulate them
// using the native language (Tcl, Python, Java, or whatever language Vtk is wrapped
// in). This, in a way, removes the need for the route and script mechanism 
// (not completely though).
