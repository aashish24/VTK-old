// .NAME vtkVRMLImporter - imports VRML 2.0 files.
// .SECTION Description
//
// vtkVRMLImporter imports VRML 2.0 files into vtk.
// .SECTION Caveats
//
// These nodes are currently supported:
//      Appearance                              IndexedFaceSet
//      Box                                     IndexedLineSet
//      Color                                   Material
//      Cone                                    Shape
//      Coordinate                              Sphere
//      Cylinder                                Transform
//      DirectionalLight
//
// As you can see this implementation focuses on getting the geometry
// translated.  The routes and scripting nodes are ignored since they deal
// with directly accessing a nodes internal structure based on the VRML
// spec. Since this is a translation the internal data structures differ
// greatly from the VRML spec and the External Authoring Interface (see the
// VRML spec). The DEF/USE mechanism does allow the Vtk user to extract
// objects from the scene and directly manipulate them using the native
// language (Tcl, Python, Java, or whatever language Vtk is wrapped
// in). This, in a way, removes the need for the route and script mechanism
// (not completely though).
