// .NAME vtkGLUTesselatorTriangleFilter - create triangle polygons from input polygons and triangle strips
// .SECTION Description
// vtkGLUTesselatorTriangleFilter generates triangles from input polygons and
// triangle strips. The filter also will pass through vertices and lines, if
// requested. 
//
// This filter is a specialized version of vtkTriangleFilter. It uses
// glu code to perform the tessellation. To use this filter, you will
// have to link against a GLU library.
//
// .SECTION See Also
// vtkTriangleFilter
