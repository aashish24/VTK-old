// .NAME vtkPolyDataToImageStencil
// .SECTION Description
// vtkPolyDataToImageStencil will convert a vtkPolyData into an image
// that can be used with vtkImageStecil or other vtk classes that apply
// a stencil to an image.  The algorithm used is as follows:
// First a YZ projection plane is defined, where each YZ pixel has a list
// for storing X values that are associated with that YZ position.
// Each polygon is projected onto the YZ plane and the X value for each
// projected YZ point is stored. After this is done for all the polygons,
// each list of X values is sorted from lowest to greatest.  Each list
// of X values hence defines the intersection points of a ray along
// the X direction at position YZ with the polygons that form the
// polydata. These stored intersection points are used to create the
// vtkImageStencilData.
// .SECTION Caveats
// This filter does not work on 2D polydata. The polydata must form a
// closed 3D surface.
// .SECTION Thanks
// Thanks to David Gobbi and Glen Lehmann of Atamai Inc. for
// developing this class.
// .SECTION see also
