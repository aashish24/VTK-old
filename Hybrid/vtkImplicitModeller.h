// .NAME vtkImplicitModeller - compute distance from input geometry on structured point dataset
// .SECTION Description
// vtkImplicitModeller is a filter that computes the distance from the input
// geometry to the points of an output structured point set. This distance
// function can then be "contoured" to generate new, offset surfaces from
// the original geometry. An important feature of this object is
// "capping". If capping is turned on, after the implicit model is created,
// the values on the boundary of the structured points dataset are set to
// the cap value. This is used to force closure of the resulting contoured
// surface. Note, however, that large cap values can generate weird surface
// normals in those cells adjacent to the boundary of the dataset. Using
// smaller cap value will reduce this effect.
//
// Another important ivar is MaximumDistance. This controls how far into the
// volume the distance function is computed from the input geometry.  Small
// values give significant increases in performance. However, there can
// strange sampling effects at the extreme range of the MaximumDistance.
//
// In order to properly execute and sample the input data, a rectangular
// region in space must be defined (this is the ivar ModelBounds).  If not
// explicitly defined, the model bounds will be computed. Note that to avoid
// boundary effects, it is possible to adjust the model bounds (i.e., using
// the AdjustBounds and AdjustDistance ivars) to strictly contain the
// sampled data.
//
// This filter has one other unusual capability: it is possible to append
// data in a sequence of operations to generate a single output. This is
// useful when you have multiple datasets and want to create a
// conglomeration of all the data.
