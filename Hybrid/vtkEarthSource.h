// .NAME vtkEarthSource - create the continents of the Earth as a sphere
// .SECTION Description
// vtkEarthSource creates a spherical rendering of the geographical shapes
// of the major continents of the earth. The OnRatio determines
// how much of the data is actually used. The radius defines the radius
// of the sphere at which the continents are placed. Obtains data from
// an imbeded array of coordinates.

  // for now.
