// .NAME vtkImageTwoInputFilter - Generic superclass for filters that have
// two inputs.
// .SECTION Description
// vtkImageTwoInputFilter handles two inputs.  
// It is just a subclass of vtkImageMultipleInputFilter with some
// methods that are specific to two inputs.  Although the inputs are labeled
// input1 and input2, they are stored in an array indexed starting at 0.
