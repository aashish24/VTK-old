// Description:
// This method returns an object which will generate regions.
// For non cached sources, it returns the source itself.
// The convention for connection elements in an image pipeline is
// "consumer->SetInput(source->GetOutput)".  It is primarily
// designed to allows sources with multple outputs.

// Description:
// This method returns the maximum MTime of this source and all the objects
// that come before this source (that can change this sources output).
// Elegagent MTime propagation is very difficult, and is still unresolved.
// The current impelentation works, but other mechanisms are being considered.
