// .NAME vtkMergePoints - merge exactly coincident points
// .SECTION Description
// vtkMergePoints is a locator object to quickly locate points in 3D.
// The primary difference between vtkMergePoints and its superclass
// vtkPointLocator is that vtkMergePoints merges precisely coincident points
// and is therefore much faster.
// .SECTION See Also
// vtkCleanPolyData
