// .NAME vtkStructuredGridToStructuredGridFilter - abstract filter class
// .SECTION Description
// vtkStructuredPointsToStructuredPointsFilter is an abstract filter class 
// whose subclasses take on input a structured grid  and generate a
// structured grid on output.

  // Set / get the input Grid or filter.
