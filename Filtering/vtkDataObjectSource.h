// .NAME vtkDataObjectSource - abstract class specifies interface for
//  field source (or objects that generate field output)

// .SECTION Description
// vtkDataObjectSource is an abstract object that specifies behavior and
// interface of field source objects. Field source objects are source objects
// that create vtkFieldData (field data) on output.
//
// Concrete subclasses of vtkDataObjectSource must define Update() and
// Execute() methods. The public method Update() invokes network execution
// and will bring the network up-to-date. The protected Execute() method
// actually does the work of data creation/generation. The difference between
// the two methods is that Update() implements input consistency checks and
// modified time comparisons and then invokes the Execute() which is an
// implementation of a particular algorithm.
//
// vtkDataObjectSource provides a mechanism for invoking the methods
// StartMethod() and EndMethod() before and after object execution (via
// Execute()). These are convenience methods you can use for any purpose
// (e.g., debugging info, highlighting/notifying user interface, etc.) These
// methods accept a single void* pointer that can be used to send data to the
// methods. It is also possible to specify a function to delete the argument
// via StartMethodArgDelete and EndMethodArgDelete.
//
// Another method, ProgressMethod() can be specified. Some filters invoke this 
// method periodically during their execution. The use is similar to that of 
// StartMethod() and EndMethod().
//
// An important feature of subclasses of vtkDataObjectSource is that it is
// possible to control the memory-management model (i.e., retain output
// versus delete output data). If enabled the ReleaseDataFlag enables the
// deletion of the output data once the downstream process object finishes
// processing the data (please see text).
