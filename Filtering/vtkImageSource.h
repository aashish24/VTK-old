// .NAME vtkImageSource - Source of data for pipeline.
// .SECTION Description
// vtkImageSource objects can be used as Input to a consumer in a pipeline.
// If for some reason you want to make a source that does not have a cache,
// it can be a subclass of vtkImageSource.
// The only requirement for a source is that it have a RequestRegion method.
// It will be compatible in any vtkImage pipline (splitting and all).
