// .NAME vtkImageSource - Source of vtkImageRegion in an image pipeline.
// .SECTION Description
// vtkImageSource objects can be used as Input to a consumer in an
// image pipeline.  Right now, the class structure is arranged for maximum
// flexability.  The subclass vtkImageCachedSource primarily used 
// for pipeline objects and is a more structured class.  If for some reason
// the application designer wants to create a uniqued tailored pipeline
// object, it can be created as a subclass vtkImageSource.  The new
// filter/source is interchangable with any other vtkImageCachedSource,
// but must handle its own data management.

  // If the failure is not memory related, and splitting the request
  // will not help, split factor should be set to zero.
