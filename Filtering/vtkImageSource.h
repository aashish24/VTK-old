// .NAME vtkImageSource - Source of data for pipeline.
// .SECTION Description
// vtkImageSource is the supperclass for all imaging sources and filters.
// The method Update, called by the cache, is the major interface
// to the source.

// .SECTION See Also
// vtkImageCache vtkImageFilter

  // Description:
  // This method sets the value of the caches ReleaseDataFlag.  When this flag
  // is set, the cache releases its data after every generate.  When a default
  // cache is created, this flag is automatically set.
  virtual void SetReleaseDataFlag(int value);

  // Description:
  // This method gets the value of the caches ReleaseDataFlag.
  int  GetReleaseDataFlag();

  // Description:
  // This method can be used to intercept a generate call made to a cache.
  // It allows a source to generate a larger region than was originally 
  // specified.  The default method does not alter the specified region extent.
  virtual void InterceptCacheUpdate();

  // Description:
  // This method is called by the cache.
  virtual void InternalUpdate(vtkImageData *data);

  // Description:
  // This method can be called directly.
  // It simply forwards the update to the cache.
  virtual void Update();

  // Description:
  // This method updates the cache with the whole image extent.
  virtual void UpdateWholeExtent();

  // Description:
  // This method updates the instance variables "WholeExtent", "Spacing",
  // "Origin", "Bounds" etc.  It needs to be separate from "Update" because
  // the image information may be needed to compute the required UpdateExtent
  // of the input (see "vtkImageFilter").
  virtual void UpdateImageInformation() = 0;

  // Description:
  // Returns the maximum mtime of this source and every object which effects
  // this sources output. 
  virtual unsigned long GetPipelineMTime();

  // Description:
  // Returns an object which will generate data for Regions.
  vtkImageCache *GetOutput();

  // Description:
  // Use this method to specify a cache object for the filter.  
  // If a cache has been set previously, it is deleted, and caches
  // are not reference counted yet.  BE CAREFUL.
  // The Source of the Cache is set as a side action.
  virtual void SetCache(vtkImageCache *cache);

  // Description:
  // Returns the cache object of the source.  If one does not exist, a default
  // is created.
  vtkImageCache *GetCache();
  
  // Description:
  // subclass can over ride this method to do custom streaming and
  // splitting for multiprocessing.
  virtual int SplitExtent(int splitExt[6], int startExt[6], 
			  int num, int total);

  // Description:
  // This UnRegister method detects the small reference counting loop:
  // ImageSource <-> ImageCache, and destructs anyway.
