// .NAME vtkImageSource - Source of vtkImageRegion in an image pipeline.
// .SECTION Description
// vtkImageSource objects can be used as Input to a consumer in an
// image pipeline.  Right now, the class structure is arranged for maximum
// flexability.  The subclass vtkImageCachedSource primarily used 
// for pipeline objects and is a more structured class.  If for some reason
// the application designer wants to create a uniqued tailored pipeline
// object, it can be created as a subclass vtkImageSource.  The new
// filter/source is interchangable with any other vtkImageCachedSource,
// but must handle its own data management.

  // Description:
  // This method returns the data type of the region that will be returned by
  // the UpdateRegion method.  This method is used to automatically set
  // the DataTypes of elements in the pipline.  When this source is set as an 
  // input, the consumer may call this function and use the returned DataType
  // as a default.

  // Description:
  // If UpdateRegion fails, "SplitFactor" has to be set.
  // If the failure was due to a memory limitation, SplitFactor 
  // suggests that the region should be broken into "SplitFactor" 
  // number of pieces for the next call to suceed.  
  // If the failure is not memory related, and splitting the region
  // will not help, split factor should be set to zero.
  // This should really be in the region object.
