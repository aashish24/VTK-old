// .NAME vtkPointSetToPointSetFilter - abstract filter class 
// .SECTION Description
// vtkPointSetToPointSetFilter is an abstract filter class whose subclasses
// take as input a point set and generates a point set on output.  At a
// minimum, the concrete subclasses of vtkPointSetToPointSetFilter modify
// their point coordinates. They never modify their topological form,
// however.
//
// This is an abstract filter type. What that means is that the output of the
// filter is an abstract type (i.e., vtkPointSet), no matter what the input
// of the filter is. This can cause problems connecting together filters due
// to the change in dataset type. (For example, in a series of filters
// processing vtkPolyData, when a vtkPointSetToPointSetFilter or subclass is
// introduced into the pipeline, if the filter downstream of it takes
// vtkPolyData as input, the pipeline connection cannot be made.) To get
// around this problem, use one of the convenience methods to return a
// concrete type (e.g., vtkGetPolyDataOutput(), GetStructuredGridOutput(),
// etc.).
