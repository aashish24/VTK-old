// .NAME vtkPointSetToPointSetFilter - abstract filter class 
// .SECTION Description
// vtkPointSetToPointSetFilter is an abstract filter class whose subclasses
// take as input a point set and generates a point set on output.
// At a minimum, the concrete subclasses of vtkPointSetToPointSetFilter
// modify their point coordinates. They never modify their topological 
// form, however.

// .SECTION See Also
// vtkTransformFilter vtkWarpScalar vtkWarpTo vtkWarpVector
