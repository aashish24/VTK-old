// .NAME vtkScalarTree - organize data according to scalar values (used to accelerate contouring operations)

// .SECTION Description
// vtkScalarTree is an abstract class that defines the API to concrete
// scalar tree subclasses. A scalar tree is a data structure that organizes
// data according to its scalar value. This allows rapid access to data for
// those algorithms that access the data based on scalar value. For example,
// isocontouring operates on cells based on the scalar (isocontour) value.
//
// To use subclasses of this class, you must specify a dataset to operate on,
// and then specify a scalar value in the InitTraversal() method. Then
// calls to GetNextCell() return cells whose scalar data contains the
// scalar value specified.

// .SECTION See Also
// vtkSimpleScalarTree vtkBONOScalarTree
