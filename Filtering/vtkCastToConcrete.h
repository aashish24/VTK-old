// .NAME vtkCastToConcrete - works around type-checking limitations
// .SECTION Description
// vtkCastToConcrete is a filter that works around type-checking limitations
// in the filter classes. Some filters generate abstract types on output, 
// and cannot be connected to the input of filters requiring a concrete
// input type. For example, vtkElevationFilter generates vtkDataSet for output,
// and cannot be connected to vtkDecimate, because vtkDecimate requires 
// vtkPolyData as input. This is true even though (in this example) the input 
// to vtkElevationFilter is of type vtkPolyData, and you know the output of 
// vtkElevationFilter is the same type as its input.
//
// vtkCastToConcrete performs run-time checking to insure that output type
// is of the right type. An error message will result if you try to cast
// an input type improperly. Otherwise, the filter performs the appropriate
// cast and returns the data.

// .SECTION Caveats
// You must specify the input before you can get the output. Otherwise an
// error results.
