// .NAME vtkMutableUndirectedGraph - An editable undirected graph.

// .SECTION Description
// vtkMutableUndirectedGraph is an undirected graph with additional functions
// for adding vertices and edges. ShallowCopy(), DeepCopy(), CheckedShallowCopy(),
// and CheckedDeepCopy() will succeed when the argument is a vtkUndirectedGraph
// or vtkMutableUndirectedGraph.

  // Description:
  // Adds a new vertex to the graph and returns the id of that vertex.
  // If non-null, propertyArr provides properties that will be attached
  // to this vertex. The values in propertyArr must match up with the
  // arrays in the vertex data retrieved by GetVertexData.
  // In a distributed graph, this routine cannot be used to add a vertex
  // if the vertices in the graph have pedigree IDs, because this routine
  // will always add the vertex locally, which may conflict with the
  // proper location of the vertex based on the distribution of the
  // pedigree IDs.

  // If the graph has pedigree IDs for its vertices, and a vertex with 
  // the given pedigree ID already exists, its properties will be
  // overwritten with the properties in propertyArr and its ID will be
