// .NAME vtkCellLocator - octree-based spatial search object to quickly locate cells
// .SECTION Description
// vtkCellLocator is a spatial search object to quickly locate cells in 3-D.
// vtkCellLocator uses a uniform-level octree subdivision, where each octant
// carries an indication of whether it is empty or not, and each leaf octant 
// carries a list of the cells inside of it. (An octant is not empty if it 
// has one or more cells inside of it). Typical operation are intersection 
// with a line to return candidate cells, or intersection with another 
// vtkCellLocator to return candidate cells.
// .SECTION Caveats
// Many other types of spatial locators have been developed such as 
// variable depth octrees and k-d trees. These are often more efficient 
// for the operations described here.
