// .NAME vtkCellLocator - octree-based spatial search object to quickly locate cells
// .SECTION Description
// vtkCellLocator is a spatial search object to quickly locate cells in 3D.
// vtkCellLocator uses a uniform-level octree subdivision, where each octant
// (an octant is also referred to as a bucket) carries an indication of whether 
// it is empty or not, and each leaf octant carries a list of the cells inside 
// of it. (An octant is not empty if it has one or more cells inside of it.) 
// Typical operations are intersection with a line to return candidate cells, 
// or intersection with another vtkCellLocator to return candidate cells.

// .SECTION Caveats
// Many other types of spatial locators have been developed, such as 
// variable depth octrees and kd-trees. These are often more efficient 
// for the operations described here. vtkCellLocator has been designed
// for subclassing; so these locators can be derived if necessary.
