// .NAME vtkImplicitBoolean - implicit function consisting of boolean combinations of implicit functions
// .SECTION Description
// vtkImplicitBoolean is an implicit function consisting of boolean
// combinations of implicit functions. The class has a list of functions
// (FunctionList) that are combined according to a specified operator
// (VTK_UNION or VTK_INTERSECTION or VTK_DIFFERENCE). You can use nested
// combinations of vtkImplicitFunctions (and/or vtkImplicitBoolean) to create
// elaborate implicit functions.  vtkImplicitBoolean is a concrete
// implementation of vtkImplicitFunction.
//
// The operators work as follows. The VTK_UNION operator takes the minimum
// value of all implicit functions. The VTK_INTERSECTION operator takes the
// maximum value of all implicit functions. The VTK_DIFFERENCE operator
// subtracts the 2nd through last implicit functions from the first.
