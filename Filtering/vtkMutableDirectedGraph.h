// .NAME vtkMutableDirectedGraph - An editable directed graph.
//
// .SECTION Description
// vtkMutableDirectedGraph is a directed graph which has additional methods
// for adding edges and vertices. AddChild() is a convenience method for
// constructing trees. ShallowCopy(), DeepCopy(), CheckedShallowCopy() and
// CheckedDeepCopy() will succeed for instances of vtkDirectedGraph,
// vtkMutableDirectedGraph and vtkTree.

  // Description:
  // Adds a vertex to the graph, and returns the id of that vertex.
  // If non-null, propertyArr provides properties that will be attached
  // to this vertex. The values in propertyArr must match up with the
  // arrays in the vertex data retrieved by GetVertexData.
  // In a distributed graph, this routine cannot be used to add a vertex
  // if the vertices in the graph have pedigree IDs, because this routine
  // will always add the vertex locally, which may conflict with the
  // proper location of the vertex based on the distribution of the
  // pedigree IDs.

  // Adds a vertex to the graph, and returns the id of that vertex.
  // If non-null, propertyArr provides properties that will be attached
  // to this vertex. The values in propertyArr must match up with the
  // arrays in the vertex data retrieved by GetVertexData.
  // If the graph has pedigree IDs for its vertices, and a vertex with
  // the given pedigree ID already exists, its properties will be
  // overwritten with the properties in propertyArr and its ID will be
  // returned. Note that, in a distributed graph with pedigree IDs,
  // the vertex added or found might not be local. In this case,
  // AddVertex will wait until the vertex can be added or found
  // remotely, so that the proper vertex ID can be returned. If you
  // don't actually need to use the vertex ID, consider calling
  // LazyAddVertex, which provides better performance by eliminating
  // the delays associated with returning the vertex ID.
