// .NAME vtkSimpleImageToImageFilter - Generic image filter with one input.
// .SECTION Description
// vtkSimpleImageToImageFilter is a filter which aims to avoid much
// of the complexity associated with vtkImageToImageFilter (i.e.
// support for pieces, multi-threaded operation). If you need to write
// a simple image-image filter which operates on the whole input, use
// this as the superclass. The subclass has to provide only an execute
// method which takes input and output as arguments. Memory allocation
// is handled in vtkSimpleImageToImageFilter. Also, you are guaranteed to
// have a valid input in the Execute(input, output) method. By default, 
// this filter
// requests it's input's whole extent and copies the input's information
// (spacing, whole extent etc...) to the output. If the output's setup
// is different (for example, if it performs some sort of sub-sampling),
// ExecuteInformation has to be overwritten. As an example of how this
// can be done, you can look at vtkImageShrink3D::ExecuteInformation.
// For a complete example which uses templates to support generic data
// types, see  vtkSimpleFilterExample.
