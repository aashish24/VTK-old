// .NAME vtkImplicitVolume - treat a volume as if it were an implicit function
// .SECTION Description
// vtkImplicitVolume treats a volume (e.g., structured point dataset)
// as if it were an implicit function. This means it computes a function
// value and gradient. vtkImplicitVolume is a concrete implementation of 
// vtkImplicitFunction.
//
// vtkImplicitDataSet computes the function (at the point x) by performing 
// cell interpolation. That is, it finds the cell containing x, and then
// uses the cell's interpolation functions to compute an interpolated
// scalar value at x. (A similar approach is used to find the
// gradient, if requested.) Points outside of the dataset are assigned 
// the value of the ivar OutValue, and the gradient value OutGradient.

// .SECTION Caveats
// Works for 3D structured points datasets, 0D-2D datasets won't work properly.

// .SECTION See Also
// vtkImplicitFunction vtkImplicitDataSet vtkClipPolyData vtkCutter
// vtkImplicitWindowFunction
