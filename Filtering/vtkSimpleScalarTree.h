// .NAME vtkSimpleScalarTree - organize data according to scalar values (used to accelerate contouring operations)
// .SECTION Description
// vtkSimpleScalarTree creates a pointerless binary tree that helps search for
// cells that lie within a particular scalar range. This object is used to
// accelerate some contouring (and other scalar-based techniques).
// 
// The tree consists of an array of (min,max) scalar range pairs per node in
// the tree. The (min,max) range is determined from looking at the range of
// the children of the tree node. If the node is a leaf, then the range is
// determined by scanning the range of scalar data in n cells in the
// dataset. The n cells are determined by arbitrary selecting cell ids from
// id(i) to id(i+n), and where n is specified using the BranchingFactor
// ivar. Note that leaf node i=0 contains the scalar range computed from
// cell ids (0,n-1); leaf node i=1 contains the range from cell ids (n,2n-1);
// and so on. The implication is that there are no direct lists of cell ids
// per leaf node, instead the cell ids are implicitly known.
