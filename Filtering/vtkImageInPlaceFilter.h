// .NAME vtkImageInPlaceFilter - Filter that operates in place.
// .SECTION Description
// vtkImageInPlaceFilter is a filter super class that 
// operates directly on the input region.  The data is copied
// if the requested region has different extent than the input region
// or some other object is referencing the input region.  No streaming
// is available for in-place filters.

// .SECTION See Also
// vtkImageFilter vtImageMultipleInputFilter vtkImageTwoInputFilter
// vtkImageTwoOutputFilter
