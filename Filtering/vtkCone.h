// .NAME vtkCone - implicit function for a cone
// .SECTION Description
// vtkCone computes the implicit function and function gradient for a cone.
// vtkCone is a concrete implementation of vtkImplicitFunction. The cone vertex
// is located at the origin with axis of rotation coincident with x-axis. (Use
// the superclass' vtkImplicitFunction transformation matrix if necessary to 
// reposition.) The angle specifies the angle between the axis of rotation 
// and the side of the cone.

// .SECTION Caveats
// The cone is infinite in extent. To truncate the cone use the 
// vtkImplicitBoolean in combination with clipping planes.
