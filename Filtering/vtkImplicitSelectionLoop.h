// .NAME vtkImplicitSelectionLoop - implicit function for a selection loop
// .SECTION Description
// vtkImplicitSelectionLoop computes the implicit function value and
// function gradient for a irregular, cylinder-like object whose cross
// section is defined by a set of points forming a loop. The loop need
// not be convex nor its points coplanar. However, the loop must be
// non-self-intersecting when projected onto the plane defined by the
// accumulated cross product around the loop (i.e., the axis of the
// loop). (Alternatively, you can specify the normal to use.)
//
// The following procedure is used to compute the implicit function
// value for a point x. Each point of the loop is first projected onto
// the plane defined by the loop normal. This forms a polygon. Then,
// to evaluate the implicit function value, inside/outside tests are
// used to determine if x is inside the polygon, and the distance to
// the loop boundary is computed (negative values are inside the
// loop).
//
// One example application of this implicit function class is to draw a 
// loop on the surface of a mesh, and use the loop to clip or extract 
// cells from within the loop. Remember, the selection loop is "infinite" 
// in length, you can use a plane (in boolean combination) to cap the extent
// of the selection loop. Another trick is to use a connectivity filter to
// extract the closest region to a given point (i.e., one of the points used
// to define the selection loop).
