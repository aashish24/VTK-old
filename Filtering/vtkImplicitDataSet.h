// .NAME vtkImplicitDataSet - treat a dataset as if it were an implicit function
// .SECTION Description
// vtkImplicitDataSet treats any type of dataset as if it were an
// implicit function. This means it computes a function value and 
// gradient. vtkImplicitDataSet is a concrete implementation of 
// vtkImplicitFunction.
//
// vtkImplicitDataSet computes the function (at the point x) by performing 
// cell interpolation. That is, it finds the cell containing x, and then
// uses the cell's interpolation functions to compute an interpolated
// scalar value at x. (A similar approach is used to find the
// gradient, if requested.) Points outside of the dataset are assigned 
// the value of the ivar OutValue, and the gradient value OutGradient.

// .SECTION Caveats
// Any type of dataset can be used as an implicit function as long as it
// has scalar data associated with it.
