// .NAME vtkMergePoints2D - merge exactly coincident points
// .SECTION Description
// vtkMergePoints2D is a locator object to quickly locate points in 3D.
// The primary difference between vtkMergePoints2D and its superclass
// vtkPointLocator is that vtkMergePoints2D merges precisely coincident points
// and is therefore much faster.
// .SECTION See Also
// vtkCleanPolyData
