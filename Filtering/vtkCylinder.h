// .NAME vtkCylinder - implicit function for a cylinder
// .SECTION Description
// vtkCylinder computes the implicit function and function gradient for 
// a cylinder. vtkCylinder is a concrete implementation of vtkImplicitFunction.
// Cylinder is centered at origin and axes of rotation is along z-axis. (Use 
// the superclass' vtkImplicitFunction transformation matrix if necessary to
// reposition.)
// .SECTION Caveats
// The cylinder is infinite in extent. To truncate the cylinder use the 
// vtkImplicitBoolean in combination with clipping planes.
