// .NAME vtkSpline - spline abstract class
// .SECTION Description
// vtkSpline is used to create interpolated data points for specified
// data. vtkSpline is an abstract class: its subclasses vtkCardinalSpline,
// vtkKochenekSpline do the interpolation, The current implementation of
// splines is limited to data dimensions not exceeding four.
// .SECTION See Also
// vtkCardinalSpline vtkKochenekSpline
