// .NAME vtkSpline - spline abstract class
// .SECTION Description
// vtkSpline is used to create interpolated data points for specified
// data. vtkSpline is an abstract class: its subclasses vtkCardinalSpline
// and vtkKochenekSpline do the interpolation, The current implementation 
// of splines is limited to data dimensions not exceeding four.
//
// Typically a spline is used by adding a sequence of points followed by
// use of an evaluation function (e.g., vtkCardinalSpline::Evaluate()).
// Since these splines are 1D, a point in this context is a independent/
// dependent variable pair. Note that the parameter space of the spline
// ranges from (0,N-1), where N is the number of points in the spline.
//
// Splines can also be set up to be closed or open. Closed splines continue
// from the last point to the first point with continous function and 
// derivative values. (You don't need to duplicate the first point to close
// the spline, just set ClosedOn.) If the spline is closed, the parameter
// space of the spline becomes (0,N).
