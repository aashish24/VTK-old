// .NAME vtkMPIGroup - Class for creating MPI groups.

// .SECTION Description
// This class is used to create MPI groups. A vtkMPIGroup object
// has to be initialized by passing the controller. Then the
// group can be modified by adding, removing ids and copying the contents
// of another group.

// .SECTION See Also
// vtkMPIController vtkMPICommunicator

  // Description:
  // Add a process id to the end of the list (if it is not already
  // in the group). Returns non-zero on success.
  // This will not add a process id >= MaximumNumberOfProcessIds.
  int AddProcessId(int processId);

  // Description:
  // Remove the given process id from the list and
  // shift all ids, starting from the position of the removed
  // id, left by one.
  void RemoveProcessId(int processId);

  // Description:
  // Find the location of a process id in the group.
  // Returns -1 if the process id is not on the list.
  int FindProcessId(int processId);

  // Description:
  // Get the process id at position pos.
  // Returns -1 if pos >= max. available pos.
  int GetProcessId(int pos);

  // Description:
  // Copy the process ids from a given group.
  // This will copy N ids, where N is the smallest 
  // MaximumNumberOfProcessIds.
