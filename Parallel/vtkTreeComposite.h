// .NAME vtkTreeComposite - An object to composite multiple render windows.
// .SECTION Description
// vtkTreeComposite operates in multiple processes.  Each compositer has 
// a render window.  They use vtkMultiProcessControllers to comunicate 
// the color and depth buffer to process 0's render window.
// It will not handle transparency well.
// .SECTION note
// You should set up the renders and render window interactor before setting
// the compositers render window.  We set up observers on the renderer,
// An have no easy way of knowing when the renderers change.  We could 
// create AddRenderer and RemoveRenderer events ...
// .SECTION see also
// vtkMultiProcessController vtkRenderWindow.
