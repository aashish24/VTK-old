// .NAME vtkAsynchronousBuffer - For pipeline execution in multiple threads.
// .SECTION Description
// vtkAsynchronousBuffer will allow a non-blocking  update of a pipeline.
// When Blocking is off, the a call to Update returns imediately, and
// the Update continues in another thread. An abort mechanism has not
// been implemented.
// WARNING:  While the buffer is updating, the upstream pipeline cannot
// be modified or caused to update by the main thread.
// WARNING: This object is currently in developement, and its API may
// change in the future (or the class may go away completely).

// .SECTION See Also
// vtkMutexLock vtkMultiThreader

  // Description:
  // A flag to change the behavior of the standard "Update" call.  When blocking
  // is off, then this method starts an update on the input, and returns 
  // immediately.  If an additional call is made before an update is finished, 
  // it returns with no effect.  If it is called after a previous update has 
  // completed, it swaps the buffers and checks to see if another update needs 
  // to occur.

  // of a down stream filter can not be compared to the modifiedTime
  // of an up stream object.
