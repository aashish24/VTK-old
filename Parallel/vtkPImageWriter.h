// .NAME vtkImageWriter - Writes images to files.
// .SECTION Description
// vtkImageWriter writes images to files with any data type. The data type of
// the file is the same scalar type as the input.  The dimensionality
// determines whether the data will be written in one or multiple files.
// This class is used as the superclass of most image writing classes 
// such as vtkBMPWriter etc. It supports streaming.
