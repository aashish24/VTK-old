// .NAME vtkCommunicator - Used to send/receive messages in a multiprocess/thread environment.
// .SECTION Description
// This is an abstact class which contains functionality for sending
// and receiving inter-process messages. It contains methods for marshaling
// an object into a string (currently used by the MPI communicator but
// not the shared memory communicator).

// .SECTION see also
// vtkSharedMemoryCommunicator vtkMPICommunicator
