// .NAME vtkThreadedController - Allows communication between running threads.
// .SECTION Description
// vtkThreadedController uses a vtkMultiThreader to spawn threads.
// The communication is accomplished using a vtkSharedMemoryCommunicator.
// The RMI communicator is identical to the user communicator.
// Note that each thread gets its own vtkThreadedController to
// accomplish thread safety.

// .SECTION see also
// vtkMultiProcessController vtkMultiThreader vtkSharedMemoryCommunicator
// vtkInputPort vtkOutputPort
