// .NAME vtkMPICommunicator - Class for creating user defined MPI communicators.

// .SECTION Description
// This class can be used to create user defined MPI communicators.
// The actual creation (with MPI_Comm_create) occurs in Initialize
// which takes as arguments a super-communicator and a group of
// process ids. The new communicator is created by including the
// processes contained in the group. The global communicator 
// (equivalent to MPI_COMM_WORLD) can be obtained using the class
// method GetWorldCommunicator. It is important to note that 
// this communicator should not be used on the processes not contained
// in the group. For example, if the group contains processes 0 and 1,
// controller->SetCommunicator(communicator) would cause an MPI error
// on any other process.

// .SECTION See Also
// vtkMPIController vtkMPIGroup

  // KeepHandle is normally off. This means that the MPI

  // of the object. However, if the handle was copied from
  // another object (via CopyFrom() not Duplicate()), this
  // has to be turned on otherwise the handle will be freed
  // multiple times causing MPI failure. The alternative to
  // this is using reference counting but it is unnecessarily
  // complicated for this case.

  // Description:
  // Copies all the attributes of source, deleting previously
  // stored data. The MPI communicator handle is also copied.
  // Normally, this should not be needed. It is used during
  // the construction of a new communicator for copying the
  // world communicator, keeping the same context.
  void CopyFrom(vtkMPICommunicator* source);

  // Description:
  // Copies all the attributes of source, deleting previously
  // stored data EXCEPT the MPI communicator handle which is
  // duplicated with MPI_Comm_dup(). Therefore, although the
  // processes in the communicator remain the same, a new context
  // is created. This prevents the two communicators from 
  // intefering with each other during message send/receives even
  // if the tags are the same.
