// .NAME vtkOutputPort - Connects pipelines in different processes.
// .SECTION Description
// OutputPort Connects the pipeline in this process to one in another 
// processes.  It communicates all the pipeline protocol so that
// the fact you are running in multiple processes is transparent.
// The output port is placed at the end of the pipeline
// (an output for a process).  It can have 
// multiple corresponding input ports in other processes that receive
// its data.  Updates in a port are triggered asynchronously, so
// filter with multiple inputs will take advantage of task parallelism.

// .SECTION see also
// vtkInputPort vtkMultiProcessController

  // Output is specified by the process the output port is in,

  // Description:
  // This just forwards the wait onto the controller, which will wait
  // for a message for any of its ports (or any RMI).
  // Since this method is implemented in the controller, multiple
  // output ports can be waiting at once (as long as they share a controller).
  // This method will only return if the BreakFlag is turned on in the 
  // controller.  The controller automatically creates a break rmi with 
  // the vtkMultiProcessController::BREAK_RMI_TAG for doing this remotely.
