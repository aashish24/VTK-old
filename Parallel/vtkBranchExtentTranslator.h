// .NAME vtkBranchExtentTranslator - Uses alternative source for whole extent.
// .SECTION Description
// vtkBranchExtentTranslator is like extent translator, but it uses an 
// alternative source as a whole extent. The whole extent passed is assumed 
// to be a subextent of the original source.  we simply take the intersection 
// of the split extent and the whole extdent passed in.  We are attempting to
// make branching pipelines request consistent extents with the same piece 
// requests.  

// .SECTION Caveats
// This object is still under development.

  // when the translator/first source is created.  The translator/assignment
  // can be used for any new filter that uses the original source as output.
  // Branches will then have the same assignment.
