// .NAME vtkCutMaterial - Automatically computes the cut plane for a meterial array pair.
// .SECTION Description
// vtkCutMaterial computes a cut plane based on an up vector, center of the bounding box
// and the location of the maximum variable value.
//  These computed values are available so that they can be used to set the camera
// for the best view of the plane.
