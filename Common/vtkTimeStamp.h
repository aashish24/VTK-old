// .NAME vtkTimeStamp - record modification and/or execution time
// .SECTION Description
// vtkTimeStamp records a unique time when the method Modified() is 
// executed. This time is guaranteed to be montonically increasing.
// Classes use this object to record modified and/or execution time.
// There is built in support for the binary < and > comparison
// operators between two vtkTimeStamps.

class vtkTimeStamp 
{
public:
  vtkTimeStamp() : ModifiedTime(0) {};

  // Description:
  // Set this objects time to the current time. The current time is
  // just a monotonically increasing unsigned long integer. It is
  // possible for this number to wrap around back to zero.
  // This should only happen for processes that have been running
  // for a very long time while constantly changing objects
  // within the program. When this does occur, the typical consequence
  // should be that some filters will update themselves when really
  // they don't need to.

  // Description:
  // Return this objects Modified time.
