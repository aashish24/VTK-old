// .NAME vtkSource - abstract class specifies interface of data sources
// .SECTION Description
// vtkSource is an abstract object that specifies behavior and interface
// of source objects. Source objects are objects that begin visualization
// pipeline. Sources include readers (read data from file or communications
// port) and procedural sources (generate data programatically).
