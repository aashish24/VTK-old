// .NAME vtkSource - abstract class specifies interface for visualization network source
// .SECTION Description
// vtkSource is an abstract object that specifies behavior and interface
// of source objects. Source objects are objects that begin visualization
// pipeline. Sources include readers (read data from file or communications
// port) and procedural sources (generate data programmatically). vtkSource 
// objects are also objects that generate output data. In this sense
// vtkSource is used as a superclass to vtkFilter.
//
// Concrete subclasses of vtkSource must define Update() and Execute() 
// methods. The public method Update() invokes network execution and will
// bring the network up-to-date. The protected Execute() method actually
// does the work of data creation/generation. The difference between the two
// methods is that Update() implements input consistency checks and modified
// time comparisons and then invokes the Execute() which is an implementation 
// of a particular algorithm.
//
// An important feature of subclasses of vtkSource is that it is possible 
// to control the memory-management model (i.e., retain output versus delete
// output data). If enabled the ReleaseDataFlag enables the deletion of the
// output data once the downstream process object finishes processing the
// data (please see text).

  // Description:
  // This method is called by the data object as part of the update chain

  // in upstream ports.  A side effect of this method is that the 
  // UpdateExtents are propagated upstream.
