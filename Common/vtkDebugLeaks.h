// .NAME vtkDebugLeaks - identify memory leaks at program termination
// .SECTION Description
// vtkDebugLeaks is used to report memory leaks at the exit of the program.
// It uses the vtkObjectFactory to intercept the construction of all VTK
// objects. It uses the UnRegister method of vtkObject to intercept the
// destruction of all objects. A table of object name to number of instances
// is kept. At the exit of the program if there are still VTK objects around
// it will print them out.  To enable this class add the flag
// -DVTK_DEBUG_LEAKS to the compile line, and rebuild vtkObject and
// vtkObjectFactory.
