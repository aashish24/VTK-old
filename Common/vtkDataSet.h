// .NAME vtkDataSet - abstract class to specify dataset behavior
// .SECTION Description
// vtkDataSet is an abstract class that specifies an interface for dataset
// objects. vtkDataSet also provides methods to provide informations about
// the data, such as center, bounding box, and representative length.
//
// In vtk a dataset consists of a structure (geometry and topology) and 
// attribute data. The structure is defined implicitly or explicitly as
// a collection of cells. The geometry of the structure is contained in
// point coordinates plus the cell interpolation functions. The topology
// of the dataset structure is defined by cell types and how the cells
// share their defining points. 
//
// Attribute data in vtk is either point data (data at points) or cell data
// (data at cells). Typically filters operate on point data, but some may
// operate on cell data, both cell and point data, either one, or none.
