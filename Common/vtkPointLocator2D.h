// .NAME vtkPointLocator2D - quickly locate points in 2-space
// .SECTION Description
// vtkPointLocator2D is a spatial search object to quickly locate points in 2D.
// vtkPointLocator2D works by dividing a specified region of space into a regular
// array of "rectangular" buckets, and then keeping a list of points that 
// lie in each bucket. Typical operation involves giving a position in 2D 
// and finding the closest point.
//
// vtkPointLocator2D has two distinct methods of interaction. In the first
// method, you suppy it with a dataset, and it operates on the points in 
// the dataset. In the second method, you supply it with an array of points,
// and the object operates on the array.
//
// This class is similar to vtkPointLocator except that it assumes the points
// are located in 2D (or at least that the z-coordinate is ignored).

// .SECTION Caveats
// Many other types of spatial locators have been developed such as 
// octrees and kd-trees. These are often more efficient for the 
// operations described here.

// .SECTION See Also
// vtkPointLocator vtkCellPicker vtkPointPicker
