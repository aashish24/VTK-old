// .NAME vtkStructuredGrid - topologically regular array of data
// .SECTION Description
// vtkStructuredGrid is a data object that is a concrete implementation of
// vtkDataSet. vtkStructuredGrid represents a geometric structure that is a
// topologically regular array of points. The topology is that of a cube that
// has been subdivided into a regular array of smaller cubes. Each point/cell
// can be addressed with i-j-k indices. Examples include finite difference 
// grids.
