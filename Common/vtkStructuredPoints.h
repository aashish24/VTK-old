// .NAME vtkStructuredPoints - A subclass of ImageData.
// .SECTION Description
// StructuredPoints is a subclass of ImageData that requires the data extent
// to exactly match the update extent. Normall image data allows that the
// data extent may be larger than the update extent.
// StructuredPoints also defines the origin differently that vtkImageData.
// For structured points the origin is the location of first point. 
// Whereas images define the origin as the location of point 0, 0, 0.
// Image Origin is stored in ivar, and structured points
// have special methods for setting/getting the origin/extents.

  // The update extent is set to the whole extent, since this is required by
