// .NAME vtkReferenceCount - subclasses of this object are reference counted
// .SECTION Description
// vtkReferenceCount is the base class for objects that are reference counted. 
// Objects that are reference counted exist as long as another object
// uses them. Once the last reference to a reference counted object is 
// removed, the object will spontaneously destruct. Typically only data
// objects that are passed between objects are reference counted.

// .SECTION Caveats
// Note: in vtk objects are generally created with combinations of 
// new/Delete() methods. This works great until you want to allocate
// objects off the stack (i.e., automatic objects). Automatic objects,
// when automatically deleted (by exiting scope), will cause warnings to
// occur. You can avoid this by turing reference counting off (i.e., use
// the method ReferenceCountingOff()).

// .SECTION See Also

// vtkScalars vtkTensors vtkUserDefined vtkVectors

// Description:
// Turn off reference counting for this object. This allows you to create
// automatic reference counted objects and avoid warning messages when scope
// is existed. (Note: It is preferable to use the combination new/Delete() 
// to create and delete vtk objects.)
