// .NAME vtkReferenceCount - subclasses of this object are reference counted
// .SECTION Description
// vtkReferenceCount is the base class for objects that are reference counted. 
// Objects that are reference counted exist as long as another object
// uses them. Once the last reference to a reference counted object is 
// removed, the object will spontaneously destruct. 

// .SECTION Caveats
// Note: in vtk objects are generally created with combinations of 
// New/Delete() methods. This works great until you want to allocate
// objects off the stack (i.e., automatic objects). Automatic objects,
// when automatically deleted (by exiting scope), will cause warnings to
// occur. You can avoid this by turing reference counting off (i.e., use
// the method ReferenceCountingOff()), but we strongly encourage you
// to not do this. Instead allocate your objects with New().

  // Description:
  // Construct with initial reference count = 1 and reference counting on.
  vtkReferenceCount();

  // Description:
  // Overload vtkObject's Delete() method. For reference counted objects the
  // Delete() method simply unregisters the use of the object. This may or
  // may not result in the destruction of the object, depending upon whether 
  // another object is referencing it.
  void Delete();

  // Description:
  // Destructor for reference counted objects. Reference counted objects should 
  // almost always use the combination of new/Delete() to create and delete 
  // objects. Automatic reference counted objects (i.e., creating them on the 
  // stack) are not encouraged. However, if you desire to do this, you will 
  // have to use the ReferenceCountingOff() method to avoid warning messages 
  // when the objects are automatically deleted upon scope termination.

  // to create and delete vtk objects.)
