// .NAME vtkWindow - window superclass for ImageWindow and RenderWindow
// .SECTION Description
// vtkWindow is an abstract object to specify the behavior of a
// rendering or imaging window. It contains vtkViewports.

// .SECTION see also
// vtkImageWindow vtkRenderWindow vtkViewport

  // you from swapping buffers between exposures.

  // buffer. It is the caller's responsibility to delete the resulting 
  // array. It is very important to realize that the memory in this array
  // is organized from the bottom of the window to the top. The origin
  // of the screen is in the lower left corner. The y axis increases as
  // you go up the screen. So the storage of pixels is from left to right
  // and from bottom to top.
