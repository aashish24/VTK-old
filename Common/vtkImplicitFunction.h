// .NAME vtkImplicitFunction - abstract interface for implicit functions
// .SECTION Description
// vtkImplicitFunction specifies an abstract interface for implicit 
// functions. Implicit functions are of the form F(x,y,z) = 0. Two primitive 
// operations are required: the ability to evaluate the function, and the 
// function gradient at a given point.
//
// Implicit functions are very powerful. It is possible to represent almost
// any type of geometry with implicit functions, especially if you use 
// boolean combinations implicit functions (see vtkImplicitBoolean).
//
// vtkImplicitFunction provides a mechanism to transform the implicit
// function(s) via a transformation matrix. This capability can be used to 
// translate, orient, or scale implicit functions. For example, a sphere 
// implicit function can be transformed into an oriented ellipse. This is 
// accomplished by using an instance of vtkTransform.

// .SECTION Caveats
// The transformation matrix transforms a point into the space of the implicit
// function (i.e., the model space). Typically we want to transform the 
// implicit model into world coordinates. In this case the inverse of the 
// transformation matrix is required.
