// .NAME vtkPropAssembly - create hierarchies of props
// .SECTION Description
// vtkPropAssembly is an object that groups props and other prop assemblies
// into a tree-like hierarchy. The props can then be treated as a group
// (e.g., turning visibility on and off).
//
// A vtkPropAssembly object can be used in place of an vtkProp since it is a
// subclass of vtkProp. The difference is that vtkPropAssembly maintains a
// list of other prop and prop assembly instances (its "parts") that form the
// assembly. Note that this process is recursive: you can create groups 
// consisting of prop assemblies to arbitrary depth.
//
// vtkPropAssembly's and vtkProp's that compose a prop assembly need not be
// added to a renderer's list of props, as long as the parent assembly is in
// the prop list. This is because they are automatically renderered during
// the hierarchical traversal process.

// .SECTION Caveats
// vtkPropAssemblies can consist of hierarchies of assemblies, where one
// actor or assembly used in one hierarchy is also used in other
// hierarchies. However, make that there are no cycles (e.g.,
// parent->child->parent), this will cause program failure.
