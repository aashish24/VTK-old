// .NAME vtkCriticalSection - critical section locking class
// .SECTION Description
// vtkCriticalSection allows the locking of variables which are accessed 
// through different threads.  This header file also defines 
// vtkSimpleCriticalSection which is not a subclass of vtkObject.
// The API is identical to that of vtkMutexLock, and the behavior is
// identical as well, except on Windows 9x/NT platforms. The only difference
// on these platforms is that vtkMutexLock is more flexible, in that
// it works across processes as well as across threads, but also costs
// more, in that it evokes a 600-cycle x86 ring transition. The 
// vtkCriticalSection provides a higher-performance equivalent (on 
// Windows) but won't work across processes. Since it is unclear how,
// in vtk, an object at the vtk level can be shared across processes
// in the first place, one should use vtkCriticalSection unless one has
// a very good reason to use vtkMutexLock. If higher-performance equivalents
// for non-Windows platforms (Irix, SunOS, etc) are discovered, they
// should replace the implementations in this class
