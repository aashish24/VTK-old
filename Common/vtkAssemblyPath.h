// .NAME vtkAssemblyPath - a list of nodes that form an assembly path
// .SECTION Description
// vtkAssemblyPath represents an ordered list of assembly nodes that
// represent a fully evaluated assembly path. This class is used primarily
// for picking. Note that the use of this class is to add one or more
// assembly nodes to form the path. (An assembly node consists of an instance
// of vtkProp and vtkMatrix4x4, the matrix may be NULL.) As each node is
// added, the matrices are concatenated to create a final, evaluated matrix.

// .SECTION See Also
// vtkAssemblyNode vtkAssembly vtkActor vtkMatrix4x4 vtkProp vtkAbstractPicker

  // Instantiate empty path with identify matrix.

  // Description:
  // Convenience method adds a prop and matrix together,
  // creating an assembly node transparently. The matrix
  // pointer m may be NULL. Note: that matrix is the one,
  // if any, associated with the prop. 
  void AddNode(vtkProp *p, vtkMatrix4x4 *m);

  // Description:
  // Get the next assembly node in the list. The node returned
  // contains a pointer to a prop and a 4x4 matrix. The matrix
  // is evaluated based on the preceeding assembly hierarchy
  // (i.e., the matrix is not necessarily as the same as the
  // one that was added with AddNode() because of the 
  // concatenation of matrices in the assembly hierarchy).
  vtkAssemblyNode *GetNextNode();

  // Description:
  // Get the first assembly node in the list. See the comments for
  // GetNextNode() regarding the contents of the returned node. (Note: This
  // node corresponds to the vtkProp associated with the vtkRenderer.
