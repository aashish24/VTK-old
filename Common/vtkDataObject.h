// .NAME vtkDataObject - general representation of visualization data
// .SECTION Description
// vtkDataObject is an general representation of visualization data. It serves
// to encapsulate instance variables and methods for visualization network 
// execution, as well as representing data consisting of a field (i.e., just
// an unstructured pile of data). This is to be compared with a vtkDataSet,
// which is data with geometric and/or topological structure.
//
// vtkDataObjects are used to represent arbitrary repositories of data via the
// vtkFieldData instance variable. These data must be eventually mapped into a
// concrete subclass of vtkDataSet before they can actually be displayed.
//
// .SECTION See Also

  // the source likely asked this object for its estimated size. If it
  // is unstructured data, then the source should have made its own
