// .NAME vtkActor2D - a actor that draws data into the viewport overlay plane
// .SECTION Description
// vtkActor2D is similar to vtkActor, but it is made to be used with
// two dimensional images and annotation.  vtkActor2D has a position
// (inherited from vtkProp) but does not use a transformation matrix
// like vtkActor.  vtkActor2D has a reference to a vtkMapper2D object
// which does the rendering.
// .SECTION See Also
// vtkProp2D  vtkMapper2D vtkProperty2D
