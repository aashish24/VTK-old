// .NAME vtkObject - abstract base class for most VTK objects
// .SECTION Description
// vtkObject is the base class for most objects in the visualization
// toolkit. vtkObject provides methods for tracking modification time,
// debugging, printing, and event callbacks. Most objects created within the
// VTK framework should be a subclass of vtkObject or one of its children.
// The few exceptions tend to be very small helper classes that usually never
// get instantiated or situations where multiple inheritance gets in the way.
// vtkObject also performs reference counting: objects that are reference
// counted exist as long as another object uses them. Once the last reference
// to a reference counted object is removed, the object will spontaneously
// destruct. 

// .SECTION Caveats
// Note: in VTK objects should always be created with the New() method and
// deleted with the Delete() method. VTK objects cannot be allocated off the
// stack (i.e., automatic objects) because the constructor is a protected
// method.

// .SECTION See also
// vtkCommand vtkTimeStamp
