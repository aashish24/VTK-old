// .NAME vtkObject - abstract base class for most of the vtk objects
// .SECTION Description
// vtkObject is the base class for many objects in the visualization 
// toolkit. vtkObject provides methods for tracking modification times, 
// debugging, and printing. Most objects created within the vtk 
// framework should be a subclass of vtkObject or one of its children.
// The few exceptions tend to be very small helper classes that usually
// never get instantiated or situations where multiple inheritance
// gets in the way. 
// vtkObject also performs reference counting:
// Objects that are reference counted exist as long as another object
// uses them. Once the last reference to a reference counted object is 
// removed, the object will spontaneously destruct. Typically only data
// objects that are passed between objects are reference counted.

// .SECTION Caveats
// Note: in vtk objects should always be created with combinations of 
// new/Delete() methods. This does not work when objects are allocated
// off the stack (i.e., automatic objects). Automatic objects,
// when automatically deleted (by exiting scope), will cause warnings to
// occur. You should not create vtkObjects in this manner.
