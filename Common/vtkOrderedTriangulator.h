// .NAME vtkOrderedTriangulator - helper class to generate triangulations
// .SECTION Description
// This class is used to generate unique triangulations of points. The
// uniqueness of the triangulation is controlled by the id of the inserted
// points in combination with a Delaunay criterion. The class is designed to
// be very fast and uses block memory allocations to support rapid
// triangulation generation. Also, the assumption behind the class is that a
// maximum of hundreds of points are to be triangulated. If you desire more
// robust triangulation methods use vtkPolygon::Triangulate(), vtkDelaunay2D,
// or vtkDelaunay3D.
//
// Background: Delaunay triangulations are unique assuming a random
// distribution of input points. The 3D Delaunay criterion is as follows:
// the circumsphere of each tetrahedron contains no other points of the
// triangulation except for the four points defining the tetrahedron.
// In application this property is hard to satisfy because objects like
// cubes are defined by eight points all sharing the same circumsphere
// (center and radius); hence the Delaunay triangulation is not unique.
// These so-called degenerate situations are typically resolved by
// arbitrary selecting a triangulation. This code does something different:
// it resolves degenerate triangulations by modifying the "InCircumsphere"
// method to use a slightly smaller radius. Hence, degenerate points are
// always considered "out" of the circumsphere. This, in combination with
// an ordering (based on id) of the input points, guarantees a unique
// triangulation.
//
// There is another related characteristic of Delaunay triangulations. Given
// a N-dimensional Delaunay triangulation, points lying on a (N-1) dimensional
// plane also form a (N-1) Delaunay triangulation. This means for example,
// that if a 3D cell is defined by a set of (2D) planar faces, then the
// face triangulations are Delaunay. Combinaing this with the method to
// generate unique triangulations described previously, the triangulations
// on the face are guaranteed unique. This fact can be used to triangulate
// 3D objects in such a way to guarantee compatible face triangulations.
// This is a very useful fact for parallel processing, or performing
// operations like clipping that require compatible triangulations across
// 3D cell faces. (See vtkClipVolume for an example.)

// .SECTION Caveats
// Duplicate vertices will be ignored, i.e., if two points have the same
// coordinates the second one is discarded. The implications are that the
// user of this class most prevent duplicate points. Because the precision
// of this algorithm is double, it's also a good idea to merge points
// that are within some epsilon of one another.

  // does not exceed the numPts specified in InitTriangulation(). Also
  // note that the "id" can be any integer and can be greater than 
  // numPts. It is used to create tetras (in AddTetras() with the
  // appropriate connectivity ids. The method returns an internal id that

  // Description:

  // allocated. (This method differs from AddTetras() in that it inserts
  // points and cells; AddTetras only adds the tetra cells.) The tetrahdera
  // added are of the type specified (0=inside,1=outside,2=all). Inside
  // tetrahedron are those whose points are classified "inside" or on the
  // "boundary."  Outside tetrahedron have at least one point classified
  // "outside."  The method returns the number of tetrahedrahedron of the
  // type requested.

  // Description:
  // Add the tetras to the unstructured grid provided. The unstructured
  // grid is assumed to have been initialized (with Allocate()) and
