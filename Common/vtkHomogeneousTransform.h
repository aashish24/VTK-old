// .NAME vtkHomogeneousTransform - superclass for homogeneous transformations
// .SECTION Description
// vtkHomogeneousTransform provides a generic interface for homogeneous 
// transformations, i.e. transformations which can be represented by 
// multiplying a 4x4 matrix with a homogeneous coordinate. 
// .SECTION see also
// vtkPerspectiveTransform vtkLinearTransform vtkIdentityTransform
