// .NAME vtkFieldData - represent and manipulate fields of data
// .SECTION Description
// vtkFieldData represents and manipulates fields of data. The model of a field
// is a m x n matrix of data values, where m is the number of tuples, and n
// is the number of components. (A tuple is a row of n components in the
// matrix.) The field is assumed to be composed of a set of one or more data
// arrays, where the data in the arrays are of different types (e.g., int,
// float, char, etc.), and there may be variable numbers of components in
// each array. Note that each data array is assumed to be "m" in length
// (i.e., number of tuples), which typically corresponds to the number of
// points or cells in a dataset.
//
// There are two ways of manipulating and interfacing to fields. You can do it
// generically by manipulating components/tuples via a float-type data exchange,
// or you can do it by grabbing the arrays and manipulating them directly. The
// former is simpler but performs type conversion, which is bad if your data has
// non-castable types like (void) pointers, or you lose information as a result 
// of the cast. The, more efficient method means managing each array in the field.
// Using this method you can create faster, more efficient algorithms that do not
// lose information.
