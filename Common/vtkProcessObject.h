// .NAME vtkProcessObject - abstract class specifies interface for visualization filters
//
// .SECTION Description
// vtkProcessObject is an abstract object that specifies behavior and
// interface of visualization network process objects (sources, filters,
// mappers). Source objects are creators of visualization data; filters
// input, process, and output visualization data; and mappers transform data
// into another form (like rendering primitives or write data to a file).
//
// vtkProcessObject provides a mechanism for invoking the methods
// StartMethod() and EndMethod() before and after object execution (via
// Execute()). These are convenience methods you can use for any purpose
// (e.g., debugging info, highlighting/notifying user interface, etc.) These
// methods accept a single void* pointer that can be used to send data to the
// methods. It is also possible to specify a function to delete the argument
// via StartMethodArgDelete and EndMethodArgDelete.
//
// Another method, ProgressMethod() can be specified. Some filters invoke this 
// method periodically during their execution. The use is similar to that of 
// StartMethod() and EndMethod(). Filters may also check their AbortExecute
// flag to determine whether to prematurally end their execution.
//
// An important feature of subclasses of vtkProcessObject is that it is
// possible to control the memory-management model (i.e., retain output
// versus delete output data). If enabled the ReleaseDataFlag enables the
// deletion of the output data once the downstream process object finishes
// processing the data (please see text).
