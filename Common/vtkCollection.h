// .NAME vtkCollection - create and manipulate unsorted lists of objects
// .SECTION Description
// vtkCollection is a general object for creating and manipulating lists
// of objects. The lists are unsorted and allow duplicate entries. 
// vtkCollection also serves as a base class for lists of specific types 
// of objects.
