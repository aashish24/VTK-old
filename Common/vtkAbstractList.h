// .NAME vtkAbstractList - a dynamic list data structure
// .SECTION Description
// vtkAbstractList is a an abstract templated superclass of all
// containers that implement list data structure.
//
// List data structure is a one dimensional sequence of elements
// with strict ordering. Every element has an index and each 
// element except the first and the last one, have unique 
// predecessor and successor. Examples of list data structure
// are dynamic array (vector) and linked list.

// .SECTION See also
// vtkContainer vtkAbstractMap

// Since some compilers have problems with keyword typename, we have 
// to do this with macros.
