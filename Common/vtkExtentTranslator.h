// .NAME vtkExtentTranslator - Generates a structured extent from unstructured.

// .SECTION Description
// vtkExtentTranslator generates a structured extent from an unstructured extent.
// It uses a recursive cheme that splits the largest axis.  A hard coded extent can
// be used fro a starting point.

// .SECTION Caveats
// This object is still under development.
