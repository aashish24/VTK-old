// .NAME vtkImageData - Holds an array of floats represtion a piece of the 
// image.
// .SECTION Description
// vtkImageData holds a reference counted 3d array of floats that is the basic
// data object of the Tile Image Pipeline.  It is not directly accessed, but
// is referenced through vtkImageRegion objects.  
// vtkImageCache objects are the only other class that uses vtkImageData
// objects directly.
// The memory of outImageData can be accessed 
// quickly through pointer arithmatic.
