// .NAME vtkImageData - Similar to structured points.
// .SECTION Description
// vtkImageData is the basic image data structure specific to the  image
// pipeline.  The axes cannot be reordered as in vtkImageRegion.  All
// the ivars are accessed as if the Axes were set to (0,1,2,3,4).
// The extent represetns the actual dimensions of the underlying memory.
// The actual memory is stored in objects (vtkPointData,vtkScalars,vtkArray)
// used in the visualization pipline, so transfer of data is efficient.
// Cuurently, only the only contents of PointData used are the Scalars,
// and vtkColorScalars are excluded.  The underlying memory can be any data 
// type.
