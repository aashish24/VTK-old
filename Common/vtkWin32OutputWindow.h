// .NAME vtkWin32OutputWindow - Win32 Specific output window class
// .SECTION Description
// This class is used for error and debug message output on the windows
// platform.   It creates a read only EDIT control to display the
// output.   This class should not be used directly.   It should
// only be used through the interface of vtkOutputWindow.  This class
// only handles one output window per process.  If the window is destroyed,
// the vtkObject::GlobalWarningDisplayOff() function is called.  The
// window is created the next time text is written to the window.
