// .NAME vtkRungeKutta4 - Integrate an initial value problem using 4th
// order Runge-Kutta method.

// .SECTION Description
// This is a concrete sub-class of vtkInitialValueProblemSolver.
// It uses a 4th order Runge-Kutta method to obtain the values of
// a set of functions at the next time step.

// .SECTION See Also
// vtkInitialValueProblemSolver vtkRungeKutta2 vtkFunctionSet
