// .NAME vtkInstantiator - create an instance of any VTK class from its name.
// .SECTION Description
// vtkInstantiator provides an interface to create an instance of any
// VTK class from its name.  Instances are created through registered
// pointers to functions returning the objects.  New classes can also be
// registered with the creator.  VTK libraries automatically register
// their classes with the creator when they are loaded.  Instances are
// created using the static New() method, so the normal vtkObjectFactory
// mechanism is still invoked.
//
// When using this class from language wrappers (Tcl, Python, or Java),
// the vtkInstantiator should be able to create any class from any kit
// that has been loaded.
//
// In C++ code, one should include the header for each kit from which
// one wishes to create instances through vtkInstantiator.  This is
// necessary to ensure proper linking when building static libraries.
// Be careful, though, because including each kit's header means every
// class from that kit will be linked into your executable whether or
// not the class is used.  The headers are:
//
//   vtkCommon    - vtkCommonInstantiator.h
//   vtkFiltering - vtkFilteringInstantiator.h
//   vtkIO        - vtkIOInstantiator.h
//   vtkImaging   - vtkImagingInstantiator.h
//   vtkGraphics  - vtkGraphicsInstantiator.h
//   vtkRendering - vtkRenderingInstantiator.h
//   vtkHybrid    - vtkHybridInstantiator.h
//   vtkParallel  - vtkParallelInstantiator.h
//   vtkPatented  - vtkPatentedInstantiator.h
//
// The VTK_MAKE_INSTANTIATOR() command in CMake is used to automatically
// generate the creator registration for each VTK library.  It can also
// be used to create registration code for VTK-style user libraries
// that are linked to vtkCommon.  After using this command to register
// classes from a new library, the generated header must be included.
