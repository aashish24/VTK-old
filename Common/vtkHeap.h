// .NAME vtkHeap - replacement for malloc/free and new/delete
// .SECTION Description
// This class is a replacement for malloc/free and new/delete for software
// that has inherent memory leak problems. For example, external software
// such as the PLY library (vtkPLY) and VRML importer (vtkVRMLImporter) are
// often written with lots of malloc() calls but without the corresponding
// free() invocations. This class allows the replacement of malloc() with
// the method AllocateMemory(). Memory is then deleted with an invocation
// of CleanUp().
//
// .SECTION Caveats
// Do not use this method as a replacement for system memory allocation.
// This class should be used only as a last resort if memory leaks cannot
// be tracked down and eliminated by conventional means.

// .SECTION See Also
// vtkVRMLImporter vtkPLY
