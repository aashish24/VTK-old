// Description:
// This operator allows all subclasses of vtkObject to be printed via <<.
// It in turn invokes the Print method, which in turn will invoke the
// PrintSelf method that all objects should define, if they have anything
// interesting to print out.

// Create an object with Debug turned off and modified time initialized 
// to zero.

// Delete a vtk object. This method should always be used to delete an object 
// when the new operator was used to create it. Using the C++ delete method
// will not work with reference counting.
