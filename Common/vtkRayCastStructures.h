// .NAME vtkRayCastStructures - the structure definitions for ray casting

// .SECTION Description
// These are the structures required for ray casting.

// .SECTION See Also
// vtkRayCaster

  // These are the input values that define the ray. Depending on
  // whether we are casting a WorldRay or a ViewRay, these are in
  // world coordinates or view coordinates.

  // The pixel location for the ray that is being cast can be
  // important, for example if hardware ray bounding is being used
  // and the location in the depth buffer must be matched to this
  // ray.

  // The world coordinate location of the camera is important for the
  // ray caster to be able to return a Z value for the intersection
  float CameraPosition[3];

  // This input value defines the size of the image

  // These are input values for clipping but may be changed
  // along the way
  float NearClip;

  // These are the return values - RGBA and Z

  // specific implementation of the ray caster. This structure
  // is a convenient place to put it, since there is one
  // per thread so that writing to these locations is safe
