// .NAME vtkWindowLevelLookupTable - map scalar values into colors or colors to scalars; generate color table
// .SECTION Description
// vtkWindowLevelLookupTable is an object that is used by mapper objects
// to map scalar values into rgba (red-green-blue-alpha transparency)
// color specification, or rgba into scalar values. The color table can
// be created by direct insertion of color values, or by specifying a
// window and level. Window / Level is used in medical imaging to specify
// a lienar greyscale ramp. The Level is the center of the ramp.  The
// Window is the width of the ramp.
// .SECTION Caveats
// vtkWindowLevelLookupTable is a reference counted object. Therefore, you should 
// always use operator "new" to construct new objects. This procedure will
// avoid memory problems (see text).
// .SECTION See Also
// vtkLogLookupTable
