// .NAME vtkOutputWindow - base class for writting debug output to a console
// .SECTION Description
// This class is used to encapsulate all text ouput, so that it will work
// with operating systems that have a stdout and stderr, and ones that
// do not.  (i.e windows does not).  Sub-classes can be provided which can
// redirect the output to a window.

  // Description:
  // This is a singleton pattern New.  There will only be ONE
  // reference to a vtkOutputWindow object per process.  Clients that
  // call this must call Delete on the object so that the reference 
  // counting will work.   The single instance will be unreferenced when
  // the program exits.
