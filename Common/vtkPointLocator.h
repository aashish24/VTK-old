// .NAME vtkPointLocator - quickly locate points in 3-space
// .SECTION Description
// vtkPointLocator is a spatial search object to quickly locate points in 3D.
// vtkPointLocator works by dividing a specified region of space into a regular
// array of "rectangular" buckets, and then keeping a list of points that 
// lie in each bucket. Typical operation involves giving a position in 3D 
// and finding the closest point.
//
// vtkPointLocator has two distinct methods of interaction. In the first
// method, you supply it with a dataset, and it operates on the points in 
// the dataset. In the second method, you supply it with an array of points,
// and the object operates on the array.

// .SECTION Caveats
// Many other types of spatial locators have been developed such as 
// octrees and kd-trees. These are often more efficient for the 
// operations described here.

// .SECTION See Also
// vtkCellPicker vtkPointPicker
