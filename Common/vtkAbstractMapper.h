// .NAME vtkAbstractMapper - abstract class specifies interface to map data
// .SECTION Description
// vtkAbstractMapper is an abstract class to specify interface between data and 
// graphics primitives or software rendering techniques. Subclasses of 
// vtkAbstractMapper can be used for rendering 2D data, geometry, or volumetric
// data.
