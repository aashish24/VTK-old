// .NAME vtkEdgeTable - keep track of edges (edge is pair of integer id's)
// .SECTION Description
// vtkEdgeTable is a general object for keeping track of lists of edges. An
// edge is defined by the pair of point id's (p1,p2). Methods are available
// to insert edges, check if edges exist, and traverse the list of edges.
