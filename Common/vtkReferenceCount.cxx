// Description:
// Construct with initial reference count = 1 and reference counting on.
vtkReferenceCount::vtkReferenceCount()
{
  this->ReferenceCount = 1;
  this->ReferenceCounting = 1;
}

// Description:
// Overload vtkObject's Delete() method. For reference counted objects the
// Delete() method simply unregisters the use of the object. This may or
// may not result in the destruction of the object, depending upon whether 
// another object is referencing it.
void vtkReferenceCount::Delete()

// Description:
// Destructor for reference counted objects. Reference counted objects should 
// almost always use the combination of new/Delete() to create and delete 
// objects. Automatic reference counted objects (i.e., creating them on the 
// stack) are not encouraged. However, if you desire to do this, you will 
// have to use the ReferenceCountingOff() method to avoid warning messages 
// when the objects are automatically deleted upon scope termination.

  // by another object
