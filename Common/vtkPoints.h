// .NAME vtkPoints - abstract interface to 3D points
// .SECTION Description
// vtkPoints provides an abstract interface to 3D points. The data model
// for vtkPoints is an array of x-y-z triplets accessible by point id.
// The subclasses of vtkPoints are concrete data types (float, int, etc.) 
// that implement the interface of vtkPoints. 

// .SECTION See Also
// vtkFloatPoints vtkIntPoints
