// .NAME vtkVectors - abstract interface to 3D vectors
// .SECTION Description
// vtkVectors provides an abstract interface to 3D vectors. The data model
// for vtkVectors is an array of vx-vy-vz triplets accessible by point id.
// The subclasses of vtkVectors are concrete data types (float, int, etc.)
// that implement the interface of vtkVectors.
