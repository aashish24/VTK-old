// .NAME vtkPriorityQueue - an list of ids arranged in priority order
// .SECTION Description
// vtkPriorityQueue is a general object for creating and manipulating lists
// of object ids (e.g., point or cell ids). Object ids are sorted acccording
// to a user-specified priority, where entries at the top of the queue have
// the smallest values.
//
// This implementation provides a feature beyond the usual ability to insert
// and retrieve (or pop) values from the queue. It is also possible to
// pop any item in the queue given its id number. This allows you to delete
// entries in the queue which can useful for reinserting an item into the
// queue. 
//
// .SECTION Caveats
// This implementation is a variation of the priority queue described in
// "Data Structures & Algorithms" by Aho, Hopcroft, Ullman. It creates 
// a balanced, partially ordered binary tree implemented as an ordered
// array. This avoids the overhead associated with parent/child pointers,
// and frequent memory allocation and deallocation.
