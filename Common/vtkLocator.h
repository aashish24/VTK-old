// .NAME vtkLocator - spatial search object to quickly locate points
// .SECTION Description
// vtkLocator is a spatial search object to quickly locate points in 3-D.
// vtkLocator works by dividing a specified region of space into a regular
// array of "rectangular" buckets, and then keeping a list of points that 
// lie in each bucket. Typical operation involves giving a position in 3-D 
// and finding the closest point.
// .SECTION Caveats
// Many other types of spatial locators have been developed such as 
// octrees and kd-trees. These are often more efficient for the 
// operations described here.
