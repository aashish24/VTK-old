// .NAME vtkLocator - abstract base class for objects that accelerate spatial searches
// .SECTION Description
// vtkLocator is an abstract base class for spatial search objects, or 
// locators. The principle behind locators is that they divide 3-space into 
// small pieces (or "buckets") that can be quickly found in response to 
// queries like point location, line intersection, or object-object 
// intersection.
//
// The purpose of this base class is to provide ivars and methods shared by 
// all locators. The GenerateRepresentation() is one such interesting method.
// This method works in conjunction with vtkLocatorFilter to create polygonal
// representations for the locator. For example, if the locator is an OBB tree
// (i.e., vtkOBBTree.h), then the representation is a set of one or more 
// oriented bounding boxes, depending upon the specified level.
// 
// Locators typically work as follows. One or more "entities", such as 
// points or cells, are inserted into the tree. These entities are associated
// with one or more buckets. Then, when preforming geometric operations, the
// operations are performed first on the buckets, and then if the operation
// tests positive, then on the entities in the bucket. For example, during
// collision tests, the locators are collided first to identify intersecting
// buckets. If an intersection is found, more expensive operations are then
// carried out on the entities in the bucket.
// 
// To obtain good performance, locators are often organized in a tree structure.
// In such a structure, there are frequently multiple "levels" corresponding
// to different nodes in the tree. So the word level (in the context of the 
// locator) can be used to specify a particular representation in the tree.
// For example, in an octree (which is a tree with 8 children), level 0 is 
// the bounding box, or root octant, and level 1 consists of its eight children.
