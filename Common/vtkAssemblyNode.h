// .NAME vtkAssemblyNode - represent a node in an assembly
// .SECTION Description
// vtkAssemblyNode represents a node in an assembly. It is used by
// vtkAssemblyPath to create hierarchical assemblies of props. The
// props can be either 2D or 3D.
//
// An assembly node refers to a vtkProp, and possibly a vtkMatrix4x4.
// Nodes are used by vtkAssemblyPath to build fully evaluated path
// (matrices are concatenated through the path) that is used by picking
// and other operations involving assemblies.

// .SECTION Caveats
// The assembly node is guaranteed to contain a reference to an instance
// of vtkMatrix4x4 if the prop referred to by the node is of type
// vtkProp3D (or subclass). The matrix is evaluated through the assembly
// path, so the assembly node's matrix is a function of its location in 
// the vtkAssemblyPath.
//
// vtkAssemblyNode does not reference count its association with vtkProp.
// Therefore, do not create an assembly node, associate a prop with it,
// delete the prop, and then try to dereference the prop. The program
// will break! (Reason: vtkAssemblyPath (which uses vtkAssemblyNode)
// create self-referencing loops that destroy reference counting.)

// .SECTION see also
