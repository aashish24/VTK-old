// .NAME vtkCommand - superclass for callback/observer methods
// .SECTION Description
// vtkCommand is an implementation of the command design pattern that is used
// in callbacks (such as StartMethod(), ProgressMethod(), and EndMethod()) in
// VTK. vtkObject implements a Subject/Observer pattern. When a subject needs
// to notify a observer, it does so using a vtkCommand.

  // Description:
  // Increase the reference count (mark as used by another object).
  void Register();
  void Register(vtkObject *) {
    this->Register(); }
  
  // Description:
  // Decrease the reference count (release by another object). This has
  // the same effect as invoking Delete() (i.e., it reduces the reference
  // count by 1).
