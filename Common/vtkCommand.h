// .NAME vtkCommand - superclass for callback/observer methods
// .SECTION Description
// vtkCommand is an implementation of the command design pattern that is used
// in callbacks (such as StartMethod(), ProgressMethod(), and EndMethod()) in
// VTK. vtkObject implements a Subject/Observer pattern. When a subject needs
// to notify a observer, it does so using a vtkCommand.
