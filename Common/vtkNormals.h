// .NAME vtkNormals - abstract interface to 3D normals
// .SECTION Description
// vtkNormals provides an abstract interface to 3D normals. The data model
// for vtkNormals is an array of nx-ny-nz triplets accessible by point id.
// (Each normal is assumed normalized |n| = 1.) The subclasses of 
// vtkNormals are concrete data types (float, int, etc.) that implement 
// the interface of vtkNormals.
