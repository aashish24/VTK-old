// .NAME vtkSystemIncludes - transition VTK to ANSI C++, centralize inclusion of system files
// .SECTION Description
// The vtkSystemIncludes centralizes the inclusion of system include
// files. (This is particularly important as VTK moves towards ANSI C++.)
// For example, this include file enables user's to build VTK with STL (i.e.,
// use std::ostream and other standard ANSI C++ functionality).  A
// compile-time flag (VTK_USE_ANSI_STDLIB) must be set to enable ANSI C++
// compliance. You'll probably also need to set various compiler flags.
// For example, on WIndows for ANSI C++, use 
// /D "VTK_USE_ANSI_STDLIB" /GX /Zm1000 .
