// .NAME vtkProp - abstract superclass for all actors, volumes and annotations
// .SECTION Description
// vtkProp is an abstract superclass for any objects that can exist in a
// rendered scene (either 2D or 3D). Instances of vtkProp may respond to
// various render methods (e.g., RenderOpaqueGeometry()). vtkProp also
// defines the API for picking, LOD manipulation, and common instance 
// variables that control visibility, picking, and dragging.

  // prop). However, classes like vtkAssembly and vtkPropAssembly can return
  // more than one path, each path being several layers deep. (See

  // Description:
  // WARNING: INTERNAL METHOD - NOT INTENDED FOR GENERAL USE
  // DO NOT USE THESE METHODS OUTSIDE OF THE RENDERING PROCESS
  // All concrete subclasses must be able to render themselves.
  // There are five key render methods in vtk and they correspond
  // to five different points in the rendering cycle. Any given
  // prop may implement one or more of these methods. The first two 
  // methods are designed to render 3D geometry such as polygons
  // lines, triangles. We render the opaque first then the transparent.
  // Ray casting is different from the other methods in that the
  // rendering process is driven not by the mapper but by the ray caster.
  // Two methods are required to support ray casting - one for 
  // initialization, and the other to cast a ray (in viewing coordinates.)
  // The next three methods are primarily intended for volume rendering
  // and supports any technique that returns an image to be composited.  
  // The RenderIntoImage() method causes the rendering to occur, and the
  // GetRGBAImage() and GetZImage() methods are used to gather results.
  // The last method is to render any 2D annotation or overlays.
  // Except for the ray casting methods, these methods return an integer value 
  // indicating whether or not this render method was applied to this 
  // data. For the ray cast initialization, the integer indicated whether or
  // not the initialization was successful. For ray casting, the integer 
  // return value indicates whether or not the ray intersected something.

  // EstimatedRenderTime in props that require information that
  // the renderer has in order to do this. For example, props
  // that are rendered with a ray casting method do not know
  // themselves how long it took for them to render. We don't want to
  // cause a this->Modified() when we set this value since it is not
  // really a modification to the object. (For example, we don't want

  // how to render this actor. 
  // The set method is not a macro in order to avoid resetting the mtime of
