// .NAME vtkProp - abstract superclass for all actors, volumes and annotations
// .SECTION Description
// vtkProp is an abstract superclass for actor type objects. Instances of
// vtkProp may respond to RenderGeometry, RenderVolume, and RenderPostSwap
// calls and may repond to more than one.
//
// .SECTION See Also

  // Description:
  // All concrete subclasses must be able to render themselves.
  // There are five key render methods in vtk and they correspond
  // to five different points in the rendering cycle. Any given
  // prop may implement one or more of these methods. The first two 
  // methods are designed to render 3D geometry such as polygons
  // lines, triangles. We render the opaque first then the transparent.
  // The next two methods are primarily intended for volume rendering
  // and support ray casting and any other technique that returns an
  // image to be composited.  The fifth method is to render any 2D 
  // annotation or overlays.

  // Description:
  // The renderer may use the allocated rendering time to determine
  // how to render this actor. (LOD Experiment)
  // The set method is not a macro in order to avoid resetting the mtime of
  // the actor - otherwise the actor would have been modified during every 
  // render.
  void SetAllocatedRenderTime(float t) {this->AllocatedRenderTime = t;};
  vtkGetMacro(AllocatedRenderTime, float);

  // Description:
  // Return the mtime of anything that would cause the rendered image to 
  // appear differently. Usually this involves checking the mtime of the 
  // prop plus anything else it depends on such as properties, textures
  // etc.

  // Get the bounds for this Prop as (Xmin,Xmax,Ymin,Ymax,Zmin,Zmax).
  // in world coordinates. NULL means that the bounds are not defined.

  // Description:
  // Release any graphics resources that are being consumed by this actor.
  // The parameter RenderWindow could be used to determine which graphic
  // resources to release.
