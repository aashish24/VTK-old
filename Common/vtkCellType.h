// .NAME vtkCellType - define types of cells
// .SECTION Description
// vtkCellType defines the allowable cell types in the visualization 
// library (vtk). In vtk, datasets consist of collections of cells. 
// Different datasets consist of different cell types. The cells may be 
// explicitly represented (as in vtkPolyData), or may be implicit to the
// data type (as in vtkStructuredPoints).

#ifndef __vtkCellType_h
#define __vtkCellType_h

// To add a new cell type, define a new integer type flag here, then
// create a subclass of vtkCell to implement the proper behavior. You 
// may have to modify the following methods: vtkDataSet (and subclasses) 
// GetCell() and vtkGenericCell::SetCellType(). Also, to do the job right,
// you'll also have to modify the readers/writers and regression tests
// (example scripts) to reflect the new cell addition.
