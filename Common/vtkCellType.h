// .NAME vtkCellType - define types of cells
// .SECTION Description
// vtkCellType defines the allowable cell types in the visualization 
// library (vtk). In vtk, datasets consist of collections of cells. 
// Different datasets consist of different cell types. The cells may be 
// explicitly represented (as in vtkPolyData), or may be implicit to the
// data type (vtkStructuredPoints).
