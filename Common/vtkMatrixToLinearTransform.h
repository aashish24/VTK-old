// .NAME vtkMatrixToLinearTransform - convert a matrix to a transform
// .SECTION Description
// This is a very simple class which allows a vtkMatrix4x4 to be used in
// place of a vtkLinearTransform or vtkAbstractTransform.  For example,
// if you use it as a proxy between a matrix and vtkTransformPolyDataFilter
// then any modifications to the matrix will automatically be reflected in
// the output of the filter.
// .SECTION See Also
// vtkTransform vtkMatrix4x4 vtkMatrixToHomogeneousTransform
