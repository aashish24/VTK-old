// .NAME vtkLogLookupTable - map scalar values into colors using logarithmic (base 10) color table
// .SECTION Description
// vtkLogLookupTable is an object that is used by mapper objects to map scalar 
// values into rgba (red-green-blue-alpha transparency) color specification, 
// or rgba into scalar values. The difference between this class and its
// superclass vtkLookupTable is that this class performs scalar mapping based
// on a logarithmic lookup process. (Uses log base 10.)
//
// If non-positive ranges are encountered, then they are converted to 
// positive values using absolute value.
// .SECTION See Also
