// .NAME vtkFunctionSet - Abstract inteface for sets of functions
// .SECTION Description
// vtkFunctionSet specifies an abstract interface for set of functions
// of the form F_i = F_i(x_j) where F (with i=1..m) are the functions
// and x (with j=1..n) are the independent variables.
// The only supported operation is the  function evaluation at x_j.

// .SECTION See Also
// vtkImplicitDataSet vtkInterpolatedVelocityField 
// vtkInitialValueProblemSolver
