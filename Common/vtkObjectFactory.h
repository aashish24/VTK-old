// .NAME vtkObjectFactory - abstract base class for vtkObjectFactories
// .SECTION Description
// vtkObjectFactory is used to create vtk objects.   The base class
// vtkObjectFactory contains a static method CreateInstance which is used
// to create vtk objects from the list of registerd vtkObjectFactory 
// sub-classes.   The first time CreateInstance is called, all dll's or shared
// libraries in the environment variable VTK_AUTOLOAD_PATH are loaded into
// the current process.   The C function vtkLoad is called on each dll.  
// vtkLoad should return an instance of the factory sub-class implemented
// in the shared library. VTK_AUTOLOAD_PATH is an environment variable 
// containing a colon separated (semi-colon on win32) list of paths.
//
// This can be use to overide the creation of any object in VTK.  
//
