// .NAME vtkImageMagnitude - Colapses 1 axis with magnitude function..
// .SECTION Description
// vtkImageMagnitude interprets one axes as a list of vector elements.
// The filter compresses this axis into one value by taking the
// magnitude of this vector.  By default the magnitude is taken over
// VTK_IMAGE_COMPONENT_AXIS.  The output and input can be any
// independent type.
