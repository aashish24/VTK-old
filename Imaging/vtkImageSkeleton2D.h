// .NAME vtkImageSkeleton2D - Skeleton of 2D images.
// .SECTION Description
// vtkImageSkeleton2D should leave only single pixel width lines
// of non-zero-valued pixels (values of 1 are not allowed).  
// It works by erosion on a 3x3 neighborhood with special rules.
// The number of iterations determines how far the filter can erode.
// There are three pruning levels:  
//  prune == 0 will leave traces on all angles...
//  prune == 1 will not leave traces on 135 degree angles, but will on 90.
//  prune == 2 does not leave traces on any angles leaving only closed loops.
// Prune defaults to zero. The output scalar type is the same as the input.
