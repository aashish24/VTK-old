// .NAME vtkImageIslandRemoval2D - Removes small clusters in masks.
// .SECTION Description
// vtkImageIslandRemoval2D computes the area of separate islands in 
// a mask image.  It removes any island that has less than AreaThreshold
// pixels.  Output has the same ScalarType as input.  It generates
// the whole 2D output image for any output request.
