// .NAME vtkImageBlend - blend images together using alpha or opacity
// .SECTION Description
// vtkImageBlend takes L, LA, RGB, or RGBA images as input and blends them 
// according to the alpha values and/or the opacity setting for each input.
// The blending rules are very similar to those for VTK texture maps.   
// The alpha value of the first input, if present, is copied to the alpha 
// value of the output.  The output always has the same number of components
// and the same extent as the first input.
