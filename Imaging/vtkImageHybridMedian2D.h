// .NAME vtkImageHybridMedian2D - Median filter that preseverse lines and 
// corners.
// .SECTION Description
// vtkImageHybridMedian2D is a median filter that preserves thin lines and
// corners.  It operates on a 5x5 pixel neighborhood.  It computes two values
// initially: the median of the + neighbors and the median of the x
// neighbors.  It the computes the median of these two values plus the center
// pixel.  This result of this second median is the output pixel value.
