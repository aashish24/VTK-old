// .NAME vtkImageDecomposeFilter - Filters that execute axes in series.
// .SECTION Description
// This superclass molds the vtkImageIterateFilter superclass so
// it iterates over the axes.  The filter uses dimensionality to 
// determine how many axes to execute (starting from x).  
// The filter also provides convenience methods for permuting information
// retrieved from input, output and vtkImageData.
