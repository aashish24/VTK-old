// .NAME vtkImageDilateErode3D - Dilates one value and erodes another.
// .SECTION Description
// vtkImageDilateErode3D will dilate one value and erode another.
// It uses an elliptical foot print, and only erodes/dilates on the
// boundary of the two values.  The filter is restricted to the 
// X, Y, and Z axes for now.  It can degenerate to a 2 or 1 dimensional
// filter by setting the kernel size to 1 for a specific axis.
