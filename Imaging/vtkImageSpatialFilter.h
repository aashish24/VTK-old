// .NAME vtkImageSpatialFilter - Filters that operate on pixel neighborhoods.
// .SECTION Description
// vtkImageSpatialFilter is a super class for filters that operate on an
// input neighborhood for each output pixel. It handles even sized
// neighborhoods, but their can be a half pixel shift associated with
// processing.  This superclass has some logic for handling boundaries.  It
// can split regions into boundary and non-boundary pieces and call different
// execute methods.
