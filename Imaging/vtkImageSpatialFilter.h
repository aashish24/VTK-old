// .NAME vtkImageSpatialFilter - Filters that operate on pixel neighborhoods.
// .SECTION Description
// vtkImageSpatialFilter is meant to replace (or be a super class) of the
// 1d, 2d and 3d spatial filters.  It was written for the 2d Gradient
// filters.  It has an ivar describing the neighborhood, but does not supp;y
// methods to allow the user to modify the neighborhood.  The main
// functionalit of this class is to break the images into central
// and boundary pieces.  Different execute methods are called for these
// two classes of regions.
