// .NAME vtkImageSpatialFilter - Filters that operate on pixel neighborhoods.
// .SECTION Description
// vtkImageSpatialFilter is a super class for filters that operate on
// an input neighborhood for each output pixel.  It is setup to for
// any dimensionality.  It handels even sized neighborhoods, but their can be
// a half pixel shift associated with processing.  This superclass has some
// logic for handling boundaries.  It can split regions into boundary and 
// non-boundary pieces and call different execute methods.
