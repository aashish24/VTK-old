// .NAME vtkImageClip - Reduces the image extent of the input.
// .SECTION Description
// vtkImageClip  will make an image smaller.  The output must have
// an image extent which is the subset of the input.  Data is
// not copied in this filter.  If Automatic is On, then the new image extent
// is automatically computed to remove uniform pixel values (white space).
// Note that even small variations (ie OutputScalarType VTK_FLOAT)
// will stop the clipping.  All the data must be parsed when the 
// OutputImageExtent is recomputed.
