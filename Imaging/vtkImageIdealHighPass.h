// .NAME vtkImageIdealHighPass - Simple frequency domain band pass.
// .SECTION Description
// vtkImageIdealHighPass just sets a portion of the image to zero.  The sharp
// cutoff in the frequence domain produces ringing in the spatial domain.
// Input and Output must be floats.  Dimensionality is set when the axes are
// set.  Defaults to 2D on X and Y axes.
