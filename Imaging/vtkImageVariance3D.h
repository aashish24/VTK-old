// .NAME vtkImageVariance3D - Variance in a neighborhood.
// .SECTION Description
// vtkImageVariance3D replaces each pixel with a measurement of 
// pixel variance in a elliptical neighborhood centered on that pixel.
// The value computed is not exactly the variance.
// The difference between the neighbor values and center value is computed
// and squared for each neighbor.  These values are summed and divided by
// the total number of neighbors to produce the output value.
