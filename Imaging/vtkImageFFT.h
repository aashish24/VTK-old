// .NAME vtkImageFFT -  Fast Fourier Transform.
// .SECTION Description
// vtkImageFFT implements a  fast Fourier transform.  The input
// can have real or imaginary data in any components and data types, but
// the output is always float with real values in component0, and
// imaginary values in component1.  The filter is fastest for images that
// have power of two sizes.  Multi dimensional FFT's are decomposed so
// that each axis executes in series.

  // Description:
  // Used internally for streaming and threads.  
  // Splits output update extent into num pieces.
  // This method needs to be called num times.  Results must not overlap for
  // consistent starting extent.  Subclass can override this method.
  // This method returns the number of peices resulting from a
  // successful split.  This can be from 1 to "total".  
  // If 1 is returned, the extent cannot be split.
