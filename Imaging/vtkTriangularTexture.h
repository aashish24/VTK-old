// .NAME vtkTriangularTexture - generate 2D triangular texture map
// .SECTION Description
// vtkTriangularTexture is a filter that generates a 2D texture map based on 
// the paper "Opacity-modulating Triangular Textures for Irregular Surfaces,"
// by Penny Rheingans, IEEE Visualization '96, pp. 219-225.
// The textures assume texture coordinates of (0,0), (1.0) and
// (.5, sqrt(3)/2). The sequence of texture values is the same along each
// edge of the triangular texture map. So, the assignment order of texture
// coordinates is arbitrary.

// .SECTION See Also
// vtkTriangularTCoords
