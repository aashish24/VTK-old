// .NAME vtkImageConnector - Create a binary image of a sphere.
// .SECTION Description
// vtkImageConnector is a helper class for connectivity filters.  
// It is not meant to be used directly.
// It implements a stack and breadth first search necessary for
// some connectivity filters.  Filtered axes sets the dimensionality 
// of the neighbor comparison, and
// cannot be more than three dimensions.  
// As implemented, only voxels which share faces are considered
// neighbors.
