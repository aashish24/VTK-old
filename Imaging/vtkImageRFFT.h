// .NAME vtkImageRFFT -  Reverse Fast Fourier Transform.
// .SECTION Description
// vtkImageRFFT implements the reverse fast Fourier transform.  The input
// can have real or complex data in any components and data types, but
// the output is always complex floats with real values in component0, and
// imaginary values in component1.  The filter is fastest for images that
// have power of two sizes.  The filter uses a butterfly fitlers for each
// prime factor of the dimension.  This makes images with prime number dimensions 
// (i.e. 17x17) much slower to compute.  Multi dimensional (i.e volumes) 
// FFT's are decomposed so that each axis executes in series.
// In most cases the RFFT will produce an image whose imaginary values are all
// zero's. In this case vtkImageExtractComponents can be used to remove
// this imaginary components leaving only the real image.

// .SECTION See Also
// vtkImageExtractComponenents
