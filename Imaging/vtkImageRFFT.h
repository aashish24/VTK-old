// .NAME vtkImageRFFT -  Reverse Fast Fourier Transform.
// .SECTION Description
// vtkImageRFFT implements the reverse fast Fourier transform.  The input
// can have real or imaginary data in any components and data types, but
// the output is always float with real values in component0, and
// imaginary values in component1.  The filter is faster for images that
// have power of two sizes.

  // Description:
  // For streaming and threads.  Splits output update extent into num pieces.
  // This method needs to be called num times.  Results must not overlap for
  // consistent starting extent.  Subclass can override this method.  This
  // method returns the number of pieces resulting from a successful split.
  // This can be from 1 to "total".  If 1 is returned, the extent cannot be
  // split.
