// .NAME vtkImageCityBlockDistance - 1,2 or 3D distance map.
// .SECTION Description
// vtkImageCityBlockDistance creates a distance map using the city block
// (Manhatten) distance measure.  The input is a mask.  Zero values are
// considered boundaries.  The output pixel is the minimum of the input pixel
// and the distance to a boundary (or neighbor value + 1 unit).
// distance values are calculated in pixels.
// The filter works by taking 6 passes (for 3d distance map): 2 along each 
// axis (forward and backward). Each pass keeps a running minimum distance.
// For some reason, I preserve the sign if the distance.  If the input 
// mask is initially negative, the output distances will be negative.
// Distances maps can have inside (negative regions) 
// and outsides (positive regions).
