// .NAME vtkImageStencilData - efficient description of an image stencil
// .SECTION Description
// vtkImageStencilData describes an image stencil in a manner which is
// efficient both in terms of speed and storage space.  The stencil extents
// are stored for each x-row across the image (multiple extents per row if
// necessary) and can be retrieved via the GetNextExtent() method.
// .SECTION see also
// vtkImageStencilSource vtkImageStencil

  // return each sub-extent [r1,r2] that lies within within the unclipped
  // region in sequence.  A value of '0' is returned if no more sub-extents
  // are available.  The variable 'iter' must be initialized to zero before
  // the first call, unless you want the complementary sub-extents in which
  // case you must initialize 'iter' to -1.  The variable 'iter' is used
  // internally to keep track of which sub-extent should be returned next.
