// .NAME vtkImageIterateFilter - Multiple executes per update.
// .SECTION Description
// vtkImageIterateFilter is a filter superclass that supports calling execute
// multiple times per update.  The largest hack/open issue is that the input
// and output caches are temporarily changed to "fool" the subclasses.  I
// believe the correct solution is to pass the in and out cache to the
// subclasses methods as arguments.  Now the data is passes.  Can the caches
// be passed, and data retieved from the cache?
