// .NAME vtkImageResample - Resamples an image to be larger or smaller.
// .SECTION Description
// This filter produces an output with different spacing (and extent)
// than the input.  Linear interpolation can be used to resample the data.
// The Output spacing can be set explicitly or relative to input spacing
// with the SetAxisMagnificationFactor method.
