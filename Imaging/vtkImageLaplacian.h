// .NAME vtkImageLaplacian - Computes divergence of gradient.
// .SECTION Description
// vtkImageLaplacian computes the Laplacian (like a second derivative)
// of a scalar image.  The operation is the same as taking the
// divergence after a gradient.  Boundaries are handled, so the input
// is the same as the output.  The output is always float.
// Dimensionality determines how the input regions are interpreted.
// lines, images, or volumes.
