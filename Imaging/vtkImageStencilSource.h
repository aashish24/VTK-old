// .NAME vtkImageStencilSource - helper class for clipping images
// .SECTION Description
// vtkImageStencilSource is a helper class for vtkImageToImageFilter
// classes.  Given a clipping object such as a vtkImplicitFunction, it
// will set up a list of clipping extents for each x-row through the
// image data.  The extents for each x-row can be retrieved via the 
// GetNextExtent() method after the extent lists have been built
// with the BuildExtents() method.  For large images, using clipping
// extents is much more memory efficient (and slightly more time-efficient)
// than building a mask.  This class can be subclassed to allow clipping
// with objects other than vtkImplicitFunction.
// .SECTION see also
