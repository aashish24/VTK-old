// .NAME vtkImageNonMaximumSuppression - Thins Gradient images.
// .SECTION Description
// vtkImageNonMaximumSuppression Sets to zero any gradient
// that is not a peak.  If a pixel has a neighbor along the gradient
// that has larger magnitude, the smaller pixel is set to zero.
// The filter takes two inputs: a gradient magnitude and a gradient vector.
// Output is magnitude information and is always in floats.
