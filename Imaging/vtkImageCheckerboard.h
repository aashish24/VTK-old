// .NAME vtkImageCheckerboard - show two images at once using a checkboard pattern
// .SECTION Description
//  vtkImageCheckerboard displays two images as one using a checkerboard
//  pattern. This filter can be used to compare two images. The
//  checkerboard pattern is controlled by the NumberOfDivisions
//  ivar. This controls the number of checkerboard divisions in the whole
//  extent of the image.
