// .NAME vtkImagePadFilter - Super class for filters that fill in extra pixels.
// .SECTION Description
// vtkImagePadFilter Changes the image extent of an image.  If the image
// extent is larger than the input image extent, the extra pixels are
// filled by an alogorithm detemined by the subclass.
// The image extent of the output has to be specified.
