// .NAME vtkShepardMethod - sample unstructured points onto structured points using the method of Shepard
// .SECTION Description
// vtkShepardMethod is a filter used to visualize unstructured point data using
// Shepard's method. The method works by resampling the unstructured points 
// onto a structured points set. The influence functions are described as 
// "inverse distance weighted". Once the structured points are computed, the 
// usual visualization techniques (e.g., iso-contouring or volume rendering)
// can be used visualize the structured points.
// .SECTION Caveats
// The input to this filter is any dataset type. This filter can be used 
// to resample any form of data, i.e., the input data need not be 
// unstructured. 
//
// The bounds of the data (i.e., the sample space) is automatically computed
// if not set by the user.
//
// If you use a maximum distance less than 1.0, some output points may
// never receive a contribution. The final value of these points can be 
// specified with the "NullValue" instance variable.
