// .NAME vtkImageAnisotropicDiffusion3D - edge preserving smoothing.
//
// .SECTION Description
// vtkImageAnisotropicDiffusion3D  diffuses an volume iteratively.
// The neighborhood of the diffusion is determined by the instance
// flags. if "Faces" is on, the 6 voxels adjoined by faces are included
// in the neighborhood.  If "Edges" is on the 12 edge connected voxels
// are included, and if "Corners" is on, the 8 corner connected voxels
// are included.  "DiffusionFactor" determines how far a pixel value
// moves toward its neighbors, and is insensitive to the number of 
// neighbors choosen.  The diffusion is anisotropic because it only occurs
// when a gradient mesure is below "GradientThreshold".  Two gradient measures
// exist and are toggled by the "GradientMagnitudeThreshold" flag.
// When "GradientMagnitudeThreshold" is on, the magnitude of the gradient,
// computed by central differences, above "DiffusionThreshold"
// a voxel is not modified.  The alternative measure examines each
// neighbor independantly.  The gradient between the voxel and the neighbor
// must be below the "DiffusionThreshold" for diffusion to occur with
// THAT neighbor.
