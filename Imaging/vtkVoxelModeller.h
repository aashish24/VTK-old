// .NAME vtkVoxelModeller - convert an arbitrary dataset to a voxel representation
// .SECTION Description
// vtkVoxelModeller is a filter that converts an arbitrary data set to a
// structured point (i.e., voxel) representation. It is very similar to 
// vtkImplicitModeller, except that it doesn't record distance; instead it
// records occupancy. As such, it stores its results in the more compact
// form of 0/1 bits.
// .SECTION see also
// vtkImplicitModeller

  // Construct an instance of vtkVoxelModeller with its sample dimensions
  // set to (50,50,50), and so that the model bounds are
  // automatically computed from its input. The maximum distance is set to 
  // examine the whole grid. This could be made much faster, and probably
