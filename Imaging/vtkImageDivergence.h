// .NAME vtkImageDivergence - Divergence of a vector field.
// .SECTION Description
// vtkImageDivergence takes a 3D vector field 
// and creates a scalar field which 
// which represents the rate of change of the vector field.
// The definition of Divergence:
// Given V = P(x,y,z), Q(x,y,z), R(x,y,z),
// Divergence = dP/dx + dQ/dy + dR/dz.
