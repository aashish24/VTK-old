// .NAME vtkImageMagnify - magnify an image by an integer value
// .SECTION Description
// vtkImageMagnify maps each pixel of the input onto a nxmx... region
// of the output.  Location (0,0,...) remains in the same place. The
// magnification occurs via pixel replication, or if Interpolate is on,
// by bilinear interpolation.
