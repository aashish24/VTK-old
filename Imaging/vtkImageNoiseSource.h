// .NAME vtkImageNoiseSource - Create an image filled with noise.
// .SECTION Description
// vtkImageNoiseSource just produces images filled with noise.  The only
// option now is uniform noise specified by a min and a max.  There is one
// major problem with this source. Every time it executes, it will output
// different pixel values.  This has important implications when a stream
// requests overlapping regions.  The same pixels will have different values
// on different updates.
