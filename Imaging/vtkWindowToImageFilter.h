// .NAME vtkWindowToImageFilter - Use a vtkWindow as input to image pipeline
// .SECTION Description
// vtkWindowToImageFilter provides methods needed to read the data in a 
// vtkWindow and use it as input to the imaging pipeline. This is
// useful for saving an image to a file for example. Use this filter to
// convert RenderWindows or ImageWindows to an image format.
