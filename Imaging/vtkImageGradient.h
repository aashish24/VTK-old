// .NAME vtkImageGradient - Computes the gradient vector.
// .SECTION Description
// vtkImageGradient computes the gradient
// vector of an image.  The vector results are placed along the
// component axis.  Setting the FilteredAxes determines whether the gradient
// computed on 1D lines, 2D images, 3D volumes or higher dimensional 
// images.  The default is two dimensional XY images.  OutputScalarType
// is always float.  Gradient is computed using central differences.
