// .NAME vtkImageAppend - Collects data from multiple inputs into one image.
// .SECTION Description
// vtkImageAppend takes the components from multiple inputs and merges
// them into one output. The output images are append along the "AppendAxis".
// Except for the append axis, all inputs must have the same extent.  
// All inputs must have the same number of scalar components.  
// A future extension might be to pad or clip inputs to have the same extent.
// The output has the same origin and spacing as the first input.
// The origin and spacing of all other inputs are ignored.  All inputs
// must have the same scalar type.
