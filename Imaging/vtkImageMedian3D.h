// .NAME vtkImageMedian3D - Median Filter
// .SECTION Description
// vtkImageMedian3D a Median filter that replaces each pixel with the 
// median value from a rectangular neighborhood around that pixel.
// Neighborhoods can be no more than 3 dimensional.  Setting one
// axis of the neighborhood kernelSize to 1 changes the filter
// into a 2D median.
