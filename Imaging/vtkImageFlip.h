// .NAME vtkImageFlip - This flips an axis of an image. Right becomes left ...
// .SECTION Description
// vtkImageFlip will reflect the data along the filtered axis.
// If PreserveImageExtent is "On", then the 
// image is shifted so that it has the same image extent, and the origin is
// shifted appropriately. When PreserveImageExtent is "off",
// The Origin  is not changed, min and max of extent (of filtered axis) are
// negated, and are swapped. The default preserves the extent of the input.
