// .NAME vtkImageOpenClose3D - Will perform opening or closing.
// .SECTION Description
// vtkImageOpenClose3D performs opening or closing by having two 
// vtkImageErodeDilates in series.  The size of operation
// is determined by the method SetKernelSize, and the operator is an ellipse.
// OpenValue and CloseValue determine how the filter behaves.  For binary
// images Opening and closing behaves as expected.
// Close value is first dilated, and then eroded.
// Open value is first eroded, and then dilated.
// Degenerate two dimensional opening/closing can be achieved by setting the
// one axis the 3D KernelSize to 1.
// Values other than open value and close value are not touched.
// This enables the filter to processes segmented images containing more than
// two tags.
