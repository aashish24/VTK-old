// .NAME vtkImageMapToRGBA - map the input image through a lookup table
// .SECTION Description
// The vtkImageMapToRGBA filter will take an input image of any valid
// scalar type, and map the first component of the image through a
// lookup table.  The result is an RGBA image of type VTK_UNSIGNED_CHAR.

// .SECTION See Also
// vtkLookupTable
