// .NAME vtkSurfaceReconstructionFilter - reconstructs a surface from unorganized points
// .SECTION Description
// 
// vtkSurfaceReconstructionFilter takes a list of points assumed to lie on
// the surface of a solid 3D object. A signed measure of the distance to the
// surface is computed and sampled on a regular grid. The grid can then be
// contoured at zero to extract the surface. The default values for
// neighborhood size and sample spacing should give reasonable results for
// most uses but can be set if desired. This procedure is based on the PhD
// work of Hugues Hoppe: http://www.research.microsoft.com/-hoppe

  // Description: 
  // Specify the number of neighbors each point has, used for estimating the
  // local surface orientation.  The default value of 20 should be OK for
  // most applications, higher values can be specified if the spread of
  // points is uneven. Values as low as 10 may yield adequate results for
  // some surfaces. Higher values cause the algorithm to take longer. Higher
  // values will cause errors on sharp boundaries.

  // reasonable guess will be made.
