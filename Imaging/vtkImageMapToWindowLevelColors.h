// .NAME vtkImageMapToWindowLevelColors - map the input image through a lookup table and window / level it
// .SECTION Description
// The vtkImageMapToWindowLevelColors filter will take an input image of any
// valid scalar type, and map the first component of the image through a
// lookup table.  This resulting color will be modulated with value obtained
// by a window / level operation. The result is an image of type 
// VTK_UNSIGNED_CHAR. If the lookup table is not set, or is set to NULL, then 
// the input data will be passed through if it is already of type 
// UNSIGNED_CHAR.
//
// .SECTION See Also
// vtkLookupTable vtkScalarsToColors
