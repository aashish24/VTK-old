// .NAME vtkImageCorrelation - Correlation imageof the two inputs.
// .SECTION Description
// vtkImageCorrelation finds the correlation between two data sets. 
// SetDimensionality determines
// whether the Correlation will be 3D, 2D or 1D.  
// The default is a 2D Correlation.  The Output type will be float.
// The output size will match the size of the first input.
// The second input is considered the correlation kernel.
