// .NAME vtkImageSeedConnectivity - SeedConnectivity with user defined seeds.
// .SECTION Description
// vtkImageSeedConnectivity marks pixels connected to user supplied seeds.
// The input must be unsigned char, and the output is also unsigned char.  If
// a seed supplied by the user does not have pixel value "InputTrueValue",
// then the image is scaned +x, +y, +z until a pixel is encountered with
// value "InputTrueValue".  This new pixel is used as the seed .  Any pixel
// with out value "InputTrueValue" is consider off.  The output pixels values
// are 0 for any off pixel in input, "OutputTrueValue" for any pixels
// connected to seeds, and "OutputUnconnectedValue" for any on pixels not
// connected to seeds.  The same seeds are used for all images in the image
// set.
