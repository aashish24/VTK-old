// .NAME vtkImageExport - Gets data out of the pipeline as generic memory.
// .SECTION Description
// vtkImageExport will terminate the image pipeline and return a pointer
// to memory formated to the users specifications.  The exporter will 
// put the data in memory allocated by the user is UseOwnMemory is on.
