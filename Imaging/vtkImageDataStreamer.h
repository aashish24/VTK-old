// .NAME vtkImageDataStreamer - Initiates streaming on image data.
// .SECTION Description
// To statisfy a request, this filter calls update on its input
// many times with smaller update extents.  All processing up stream
// streams smaller pieces.

  // Slab mode first breaks up the Z axis.  If it gets to one slice,
  // then it starts bereaking up other axes.
