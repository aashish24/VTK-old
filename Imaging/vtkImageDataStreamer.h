// .NAME vtkImageDataStreamer - Initiates streaming on image data.
// .SECTION Description
// To statisfy a request, this filter calls update on its input
// many times with smaller update extents.  All processing up stream
// streams smaller pieces.

  // Description:
  // How should the streamer break up extents. Block mode
  // tries to break an extent up into cube blocks.  It always chooses
  // the largest axis to split.
  // Slab mode first breaks up the Z axis.  If it gets to one slice,
  // then it starts bereaking up other axes.
