// .NAME vtkDataSetReader - class to read any type of vtk dataset
// .SECTION Description
// vtkDataSetReader is a class that provides instance variables and methods
// to read any type of dataset in Visualization Toolkit (vtk) format.  The
// output type of this class will vary depending upon the type of data
// file. Convenience methods are provided to keep the data as a particular
// type. (See text for format description details).
// The superclass of this class, vtkDataReader, provides many methods for
// controlling the reading of the data file, see vtkDataReader for more
// information.
// .SECTION Caveats
// Binary files written on one system may not be readable on other systems.
// .SECTION See Also
// vtkDataReader vtkPolyDataReader vtkRectilinearGridReader 
// vtkStructuredPointsReader vtkStructuredGridReader vtkUnstructuredGridReader

  // Description:
  // Get the output as various concrete types. This method is typically used
  // when you know exactly what type of data is being read.  Otherwise, use
  // the general GetOutput() method. If the wrong type is used NULL is
  // returned.  (You must also set the filename of the object prior to
  // getting the output.)
