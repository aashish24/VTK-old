// .NAME vtkBMPReader - read Windows BMP files
// .SECTION Description
// vtkBMPReader is a source object that reads Windows BMP files.
// This includes indexed and 24bit bitmaps
//
// BMPReader creates structured point datasets. The dimension of the 
// dataset depends upon the number of files read. Reading a single file 
// results in a 2D image, while reading more than one file results in a 
// 3D volume.
//
// To read a volume, files must be of the form "FileName.<number>"
// (e.g., foo.ppm.0, foo.ppm.1, ...). You must also specify the image 
// range. This range specifies the beginning and ending files to read (range
// can be any pair of non-negative numbers). 
//
// The default behavior is to read a single file. In this case, the form
// of the file is simply "FileName" (e.g., foo.bar, foo.ppm, foo.BMP).
