// .NAME vtkWriter - abstract class to write data to file(s)
// .SECTION Description
// vtkWriter is an abstract class for mapper objects that write their data
// to disk (or into a communications port). All writers respond to Write()
// method. This method insures that there is input and input is up to date.
//
// Since vtkWriter is a subclass of vtkProcessObject, StartMethod(), 
// EndMethod(), and ProgressMethod() are all available to writers.
// These methods are executed before and after execution of the Write() 
// method. You can also specify arguments to these methods.

// .SECTION Caveats
// Every subclass of vtkWriter must implement a WriteData() method. Most likely
// will have to create SetInput() method as well.

// .SECTION See Also
// vtkBYUWriter vtkDataWriter vtkSTLWriter vtkVoxelWriter vtkMCubesWriter
