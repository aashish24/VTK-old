// .NAME vtkRectilinearGridReader - read vtk rectilinear grid data file
// .SECTION Description
// vtkRectilinearGridReader is a source object that reads ASCII or binary 
// rectilinear grid data files in vtk format (see text for format details).
// The output of this reader is a single vtkRectilinearGrid data object.
// The superclass of this class, vtkDataReader, provides many methods for
// controlling the reading of the data file, see vtkDataReader for more
// information.
// .SECTION Caveats
// Binary files written on one system may not be readable on other systems.
// .SECTION See Also
// vtkRectilinearGrid vtkDataReader
