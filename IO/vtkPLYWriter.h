// .NAME vtkPLYWriter - write Stanford PLY file format
// .SECTION Description
// vtkPLYWriter writes polygonal data in Stanford University PLY format
// (see http://graphics.stanford.edu/data/3Dscanrep/). The data can be
// written in either binary (little or big endian) or ASCII representation. 

// .SECTION Caveats
// PLY does not handle big endian versus little endian correctly. Also,
// this class is compiled into VTK only if the PLY library is found
// during the make process (using CMake).

// .SECTION See Also
// vtkPLYReader

  // By default, WritePointScalars is off.

  // RGBA colors. Normally the scalars are written as a vertex separate
  // property called "scalars". However, if the scalars are unsigned char
  // and three or more components, then the PLY properties "red", "green",
  // and "blue" are written; or, if the scalars have an associated lookup
  // table, then the red, green, blue properties are also written. (Note that
  // data arrays (like scalars) can have an associated lookup table as well.)
