// .NAME vtkSTLReader - read ASCII or binary stereo lithography files
// .SECTION Description
// vtkSTLReader is a source object that reads ASCII or binary stereo 
// lithography files (.stl files). The FileName must be specified to
// vtkSTLReader. The object automatically detects whether the file is
// ASCII or binary.
//
// .stl files are quite inefficient since they duplicate vertex 
// definitions. By setting the Merging boolean you can control whether the 
// point data is merged after reading. Merging is performed by default, 
// however, merging requires a large amount of temporary storage since a 
// 3D hash table must be constructed.

// .SECTION Caveats
// Binary files written on one system may not be readable on other systems.
// vtkSTLWriter uses VAX or PC byte ordering and swaps bytes on other systems.
