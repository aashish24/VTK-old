// .NAME vtkBYUWriter - write MOVIE.BYU files
// .SECTION Description
// vtkBYUWriter writes MOVIE.BYU polygonal files. These files consist 
// of a geometry file (.g), a scalar file (.s), a displacement or 
// vector file (.d), and a 2D texture coordinate file (.t). These files 
// must be specified to the object, the appropriate boolean 
// variables must be true, and data must be available from the input
// for the files to be written.
// WARNING: this writer does not currently write triangle strips. Use
// vtkTriangleFilter to convert strips to triangles.
