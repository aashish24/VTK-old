// .NAME vtkDataObjectReader - read vtk field data file
// .SECTION Description
// vtkDataObjectReader is a source object that reads ASCII or binary field
// data files in vtk format. Fields are general matrix structures used
// represent complex data. (See text for format details).  The output of this
// reader is a single vtkDataObject.  The superclass of this class,
// vtkDataReader, provides many methods for controlling the reading of the
// data file, see vtkDataReader for more information.
// .SECTION Caveats
// Binary files written on one system may not be readable on other systems.
// .SECTION See Also
// vtkFieldData vtkDataObjectWriter
