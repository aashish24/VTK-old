// .NAME vtkTIFFReader - read TIFF files
// .SECTION Description
// vtkTIFFReader is a source object that reads TIFF files. This object
// only supports reading a subset of the TIFF formats. Specifically,
// it will not read LZ compressed TIFFs.
//
// TIFFReader creates structured point datasets. The dimension of the 
// dataset depends upon the number of files read. Reading a single file 
// results in a 2D image, while reading more than one file results in a 
// 3D volume.
//
// To read a volume, files must be of the form "FileName.<number>"
// (e.g., foo.tiff.0, foo.tiff.1, ...). You must also specify the image 
// range. This range specifies the beginning and ending files to read.
// The range is specified by setting fifth and sixth values of the 
// DataExtent.
