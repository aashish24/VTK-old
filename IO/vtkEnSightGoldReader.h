// .NAME vtkEnSightGoldReader - class to read EnSight Gold files
// .SECTION Description
// vtkEnSightGoldReader is a class to read EnSight Gold files into vtk.
// Because the different parts of the EnSight data can be of various data
// types, this reader produces multiple outputs, one per part in the input
// file.
// All variable information is being stored in field data.  The descriptions
// listed in the case file are used as the array names in the field data.
// For complex vector variables, the description is appended with _r (for the
// array of real values) and _i (for the array if imaginary values).  Complex
// scalar variables are stored as a single array with 2 components, real and
// imaginary, listed in that order.
// .SECTION Caveats
// You must manually call Update on this reader and then connect the rest
// of the pipeline because (due to the nature of the file format) it is
// not possible to know ahead of time how many outputs you will have or
// what types they will be.
// This reader can only handle static EnSight datasets (both static geometry
// and variables).
