// .NAME vtkParticleReader - Read raw particle data and one array.
// .SECTION Description
// vtkParticleReader reads a raw file with particles.  It supports
// random access into the file to read pieces.  The format is:
// x, y, z, value (all floats).  This class was developed with a 
// specific file in mind, but may be made more general in the future.
// Here are a couple of features I am considering:  
// any data types could be used,
// arbitrary list of arrays to read (extended to vectors as well),
// and time serries based on file names.

  // Description:
  // These methods should be used instead of the SwapBytes methods.
  // They indicate the byte ordering of the file you are trying
  // to read in. These methods will then either swap or not swap
  // the bytes depending on the byte ordering of the machine it is
  // being run on. For example, reading in a BigEndian file on a
  // BigEndian machine will result in no swapping. Trying to read
  // the same file on a LittleEndian machine will result in swapping.
  // As a quick note most UNIX machines are BigEndian while PC's
  // and VAX tend to be LittleEndian. So if the file you are reading
  // in was generated on a VAX or PC, SetDataByteOrderToLittleEndian 
  // otherwise SetDataByteOrderToBigEndian.
