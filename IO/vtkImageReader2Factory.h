// .NAME vtkImageReader2Factory - Superclass of binary file readers.
// .SECTION Description
// vtkImageReader2Factory: This class is used to create a vtkImageReader2
// object given a path name to a file.  It calls CanReadFile on all
// availiable readers until one of them returns ture.  The availiable reader
// list comes from three places.  In the InitializeReaders function of this
// class, built-in VTK classes are added to the list, users can call
// RegisterReader, or users can create a vtkObjectFactory that has
// CreateObject method that returns a new vtkImageReader2 sub class when
// given the string "vtkImageReaderObject".  This way applications can be
// extened with new readers via a plugin dll or by calling RegisterReader.
// Of course all of the readers that are part of the vtk release are made
// automatically availiable.
//
