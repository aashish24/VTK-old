// .NAME vtkPostScriptWriter - Writes an image as a PostScript file.
// .SECTION Description
// vtkPostScriptWriter writes an image as a PostScript file using some
// reasonable scalings and centerd on the page which is assumed to be
// about 8.5 by 11 inches. This is based loosely off of the code from
// pnmtops.c. Right now there aren't any real options.
